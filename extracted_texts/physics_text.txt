PREFACE
Themost striking fact inthemodern world isthedevelopment ofour
knowledge ofphysics. Allmachines andappliances result from theappli-
cation ofthatknowledge. This textattempts togiveaninsight intoafew
fundamentals ofthesubject andanunderstanding ofsome oftheir appli-
cations. These havebeen presented inaclear, concise andyetsufficiently
comprehensive manner tomeet theneeds ofboth student and teacher.
Specifically designed tocover theOntario Course ofStudy inGrade XI
Physics, thetextincludes supplementary material which enables ittomeet
most oftherequirements ofcourses ofstudy inphysics inother provinces,
and atthesame timemakes provision fortheabove average student.
Grade XIPhysics should beanexperimental course andeach unithas
therefore aconcluding chapter ofexperiments. Theapparatus suggested
issimple enough toenable most ofthese tobecarried outbythepupils
themselves. Webelieve this special feature ofthetext willencourage
ascientific outlook inpupils andsavemuch valuable time fortheteacher.
Theneed foraccuracy and precision inmaking observations, taking
measurements, making calculations and reaching conclusions, iscon-
stantly emphasized. Toaidinthis,asection isincluded onaccuracy of
measurement andtheuseofapproximate numbers. Pupils areexpected to
work allmathematical problems, including theresults oftheir experiments,
inaccordance with these principles. Sample solutions foreachnewtype
ofmathematical problem aregiven throughout thetext. Inthese, aswell
asintheanswers provided intheback ofthebook, therules forsignificant
digits havebeen consistently observed.
Among other features which theauthors hope willbeuseful toteachers
andpupils alike, twomaybesingled outformention: Allexplanations
anddiagrams relating toelectricity arebased onthemodern concept of
electron flow. Secondly, allright-hand pages areclearly marked with
section numbers sothatdesired information maybequickly found. While
theauthors believe that these andmany other features willrecommend
thebook toitsusers, they recognize thatimprovements and revisions will
benecessary infuture editions. Tothisendthey cordially invite com-
ments and suggestions from teachers whohave used thebook intheir
classrooms.

THEMAJOR DIVISIONS OFSCIENCE
CHAPTER T INTRODUCTION
THEMEANING ANDSCOPE OF
PHYSICS
Sowide isthe subject’s scope, and
sonumerous are itsdevelopments, that
nosingle statement canconvey fully
what ismeant bytheword Physics—
except, perhaps, thestatement that this
isthefundamental science, whose prin-
ciples form the basis ofsuch other
sciences asBiology, Chemistry, Geology,
andAstronomy. Itssubject matter con-
tains theprinciples that enable usto
understand, asfaraswedo,theoperation
oftheuniverse and everything within
it,and,bytelling ushow theforces of
nature act, itenables ustocontrol them
andputthem towork inthe service
ofman. Every timeyou turnonthe
taps forabath, switch onthe electric
light, phone afriend, orone ofthe
many other things which havecome to
seem thenecessities aswell asthelux-
uries oflife,you willbeincontact with
devices whose invention wasmade pos-
siblebyaknowledge ofphysical laws.
Sovastasubject mayseemunman-
ageable; andyetadivision ofitinto all
itspossible parts would beequally be-
wildering. And so,forconvenience, a
division into several major sections, eachofwhich contains many separate sub-
jects, isgenerally made. These sections
arethesubjects oftheunits ofthisbook:
Mechanics, Sound, Heat, Light, Elec-
tricity and Magnetism, and—^inthe
chapter entitled Modern Developments
inPhysics— Nuclear Physics.
SOME EARLY DEVELOPMENTS
Butbefore coming tothese, letuslook
atoursubject’s past.
Theoretical physics may besaid to
havehad itsbeginning when primitive
man first speculated onthecauses for
the seasons, fordayand night, and
forthemotions oftheheavenly bodies,
butpractical physics didnotbegin until
heinvented such simple machines asthe
lever toliftweights and thewheel to
move them. Slow ashisprogress was,
itwasfrom thistime ofhisfirstapplying
hisphysical knowledge, inhowever fum-
bling andincomprehending away, that
hecould date hisemergence from his
primitive existence towards what we
think ofascivilization.
Society followed society, each pro-
gressing alittle together with man’s
knowledge ofphysics. The famous
civilizations ofEgypt andGreece which,
with therapid expansion ofknowledge
thataccompanied their eager enquiries
intothemysteries oftheuniverse, provide
uswith the first notable names inour
story, those ofthe philosophers, or
learned men, like Aristotle, Archimedes
andPtolemy. Archimedes, who iscele-

INTRODUCTION
brated among other things forhislaws
ofbuoyancy, isthe firstmanweknow
ofwho sought truth byexperiment.
Aristotle inGreece and Ptolemy in
Egypt, ontheother hand, relied solely
onreasoning and logic fortheir explana-
tions ofnatural phenomena andsawno
reason fortesting their speculations and
theories experimentally.
After this firstgreat awakening, little
scientific progress wasmade forcenturies
and, ingeneral, knowledge remained
fixed atthetheories ofAristotle. The
genius oftheRomans was exercised in
conquest, government andlaw rather
than inscientific enquiry. After them,
during theMiddle Ageswhen civilization
wasstruggling forexistence, itwas left
totheArabs totrytopreserve what
scientific knowledge hadbeen gained, by
collecting asmany ofthewritings of
theGreeks andother peoples aspossible.
Innorth-western Europe, anEnglishman,
Roger Bacon (1214-1294), didindeed
foresee many future scientific develop-
ments, buthewaskeptfrommaking his
theories known byfear oftheChurch
which allthistime fiercely opposed any
scientific advance.
The shackles oftheChurch’s opposi-
tionandtherigidadherence toAristotle’s
scientific theories were notinfactbroken
until the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries when thegreat rebirth ofin-
tellectual activity which we call the
Renaissance occurred. It isfrom this
time thatwedate thebeginning of
modem experimental physics. Dr. Gil-
bert (1540-1603), Physician toQueen
Elizabeth I,made the firstexperimental
study ofmagnetism, andGalileo (1564-
1642), experimentally established the
laws offalling bodies. SirIsaacNewton
(1642-1727), whohadperhaps one of
themost brilliant andpenetrating minds
before thetime ofEinstein, developed
thebasic lawsofmechanics, studied light
andastronomy, andinvented theveryuseful branch ofmathematics called
calculus.
Thecentury andmore which followed
Newton’s death saw established allthe
main branches ofphysical science which
were referred tointhe first section, with
theexception ofnuclear physics. The
work ofAmpere, Volta, Ohm, and
Faraday onelectricity was soimportant
that theirnames are stillused todesig-
nate theunits ofmeasurement ofelec-
trical energy.
Most important forthenineteenth
century, theperiod inwhich physical
investigation reached aclimax, wasthe
work onheat which gave rise tothe
idea ofthebasic importance ofenergy
asthesource ofallactivity. Allphysical
phenomena, itwas found, represent
transformations ofenergy, exchanges of
energy, ortheinteraction ofobjects that
possess energy. Thegeneral applicability
ofthisconcept ofenergy iswhat has
ledtotherather incomplete definition of
physics as“the subject which deals with
forces andforms ofenergy inouren-
vironment”. Then, later inthenine-
teenth century, thestudy ofenergy
reached itsculmination, transforming
thewhole appearance ofphysics, when
itwasrealized thatenergy istransmitted
from place toplace byawave motion
andthatthevarious branches ofphysics
aresimply different energy phenomena
transmitted inthismanner. This realiza-
tion ofthewave motion ofenergy pro-
vides thebeginner inphysics withsome
hope atleast ofunity inasubject that
appears tobegreatly diversified.
Onthepractical side, thework ofthe
nineteenth century laidthefoundations,
among other things, ofalmost allour
modern means ofcommunication, trans-
portation andpower production, both
byelectricity andatomic energy. Inthis
lastrespect science seems tohave pro-
vided asolution fortheproblems which
itsowndevelopments were raising. Many

ofthese developments made fornew
occupations, better working conditions,
ahigher level ofhealth and alonger
span oflife,with aconsequent increase
inworld population. The resulting
larger demand forevery kind ofcom-
modity necessitated such arapid con-
sumption ofenergy that theavailable
reserves oftheworld began todwindle
rapidly and scientists had toexplore, as
they are stillexploring, ways andmeans
ofavoiding disaster afewgenerations
hence. As ithappened, hope forthe
future wasprovided asearly as1905
byDr.Albert Einstein (1879-1955) when
heestimated theenergy resources of
theatom. Recently thathope hasbeen
translated into reality asphysicists have
learned torelease and control this tre-
mendous store ofenergy.
THEMETHOD OFSCIENCE
Dr. Gilbert, the first great English
exponent oftheprinciples ofmagnetism,
spoke defiantly ofspeculative scientists
and traditionalists as“men ofacute
intelligence, without actual knowledge of
factswho intheabsence ofexperiment,
easily slipand err”. Thus were con-
demned most oftheearly philosophers
andsome later oneswhosupported such
false beliefs asanearth-centred universe,

I;1SYSTEMS OFMEASUREMENT
As civilization developed and life
became more complex^ withman plant-
ingcrops, trading" goods orpurchasing
property, itbecame essential forhim
tohavesomemeans ofmeasuring length,
area, volume, massandtime.The dailymovements oftheearth, with theresult-
ingapparent motion ofthesunand stars,
provided aready-made device formea-
suring time, butthemeasurement ofthe
other dimensions could notbemanaged
sonaturally.
Man’s first systems formeasuring
them, however, were, though imprecise,
very convenient. Measurements oflength
were based upon parts ofthehuman
body (Fig. 2:1). Measurements of
weight were oftenmade byusing crude
scales inwhich theobject tobeweighed
wasbalanced against stones orseeds of

grain. Theconvenience ofthese units
isobvious. Inmeasuring aboard a
manwould nothave tohunt foraruler,
butwould have used hishand orarm.
However, inonefundamental respect,
these early units were unsatisfactory.
They were notstandard oruniform.
Moreover, with thebeginnings of
science and thegrowth oftechnology
from theinvention ofthe first simple
machines, aswehave seen, theneed for
definite andaccurate systems ofmeasure-
mentbecame imperative. Since theaim
ofscience istodescribe the facts of
experience assimply, ascompletely, and
asaccurately aspossible, measurement
isthevery basis of it.Physics isthat

cerned with themeans ofmeasurement—which iswhy physics iscalled an
“exact science”, andwhy theother divi-
sions ofscience depend, invarying
degrees, on itsspecial techniques.
What areneeded, then, arestandardunits ofmeasurement, units, that is,
which are generally acceptable, and
preferably unitswhich canbeeasily and
accurately reproduced atanytime. Yet,

Inorder tosimplify thescheme of

into relation tothree measurable mag-
nitudes, length, mass, and time, which

MEASUREMENT Sec. 1:2
There are tvvo systems ofunits in
common use,theBritish, orfoot-pound-
second (F.P.S.) system, andtheMetric,
orcentimetre-gram-second (C.G.S.) sys-
tem.The history ofthedevelopment of
these systems ofmeasurement isvery
interesting, butunfortunately cannot be
given here. The interested student can
find itinanygood reference encyclo-
pedia.
Alltheworld except thetwo great
English-speaking groups, theBritish Com-
monwealth ofNations, and theUnited
States ofAmerica, hasadopted themetric
system ofmeasurement. The metric
system isextremely simple, being nothing
more nor lessthan theapplication of
thedecimal number system tomeasure-
ments. Measurements oflength andmass
begin with abasic unit, thenext larger
unitbeing tentimes aslarge, thenext
smaller unit one-tenth aslarge, and so
on.Toconvert fromoneunit toanother
simply consists inshifting thedecimal
point one place tothe left orright,
e.g., 123metres =12.3 dekametres, or
1230 decimetres. The relationship of
each larger orsmaller unit tothebasic
unit isshown bytheprefix toitsname.
(See thetable ofprefixes above.) Thus
acentimetre isone-hundredth ofametre,
(centi=1/100),while akilometre is
one thousand metres (kilo=1000).
Moreover, fhemetric system hascon-
tinuity inthattheunitofmass isrelated
totheunitoflength. (See definition
of“gram” inthenext section.) The
British system ofweights andmeasures
ismuch morecumbersome and difficult,
both because ofthe heterogeneous
groups ofmultipliers used, andbecause
oftheunrelated units ofmass and
length.
Since themetric system hassuch de-
cided advantages over the British sys-
tem, itisused almost exclusively inthe
scientific field. While thissystem islegal
inboth theUnited States ofAmericaand the British Commonwealth of
Nations, itscommon adoption inthese
countries isprevented inlarge measure

byhabitual useoftheolder system, and
bythe large amount ofindustrial
machinery already geared totheBritish
system. The student ofscience iswell-
advised tomaster themetric system
thoroughly since aworking knowledge
ofitisessential toaproper understand-
ing ofmany scientific principles that
follow.
I:2UNITS OFMEASUREMENT

Since anobject hasthree dimensions,
length, width and height, theunits of
volume arecubic measure. From the
previous tables oflinear measure, the
student should beable toprepare tables
ofsquare measure andofcubic measure
inboth British andmetric units.
One unit formeasuring volume, the
litre, deserves emphasis above theothers

Note. The ml.and c.c.may beused
interchangeably forourpurposes, even
though thetwoarenotabsolutely iden-
tical.
(b)Mass
The unitofmass intheBritish system
isthepound. The standard pound is
thequantity ofmatter inacylinder of
pure platinum about 1.35 inches high
and 1.15 inches indiameter, kept in
theBureau ofStandards inLondon,
England. Inthemetric system, the
unit ofmass isthekilogram (Fig. 2:4),
which isthemass ofapiece ofplatinum-
iridium kept atSevres, France. Ori-
ginally itwasintended tobethemass
of1000 cubic centimetres (1litre) of

pheric pressure (i.e., 760mm. ofmer-
cury) .Thegram isone-thousandth part

I:3CALCULATIONS BASEDON
MEASUREMENTS
(a)Accuracy ofMeasurement
Intheexperiments attheendofthis
unit, chapter 5,and throughout the
book, you willhave opportunities to
make measurements and usesome of
the units mentioned intheprevioussection. Measurement seems avery ac-v
curate operation indeed, butthere isa
limit tothedegree ofaccuracy that is
possible. Ifafarmer has fivehundred
baskets offruit, this isanexact number.
When hesellsthem for fifty cents each
hewillreceive exactly twohundred and
fifty dollars, another exact number. In
thisand allother similar operations
involving anumber offinite objects, you
aredealing withexact numbers.
If,however, youmeasure thelength
ofyour living-room and saythat itis
fifteen feet long, itislikely tobea
little longer orshorter than this. In
thesamewayadoor that isthirty inches
widemaymeasure alittlemore oralittle
lessthan this.The limit ofaccuracy
isgoverned toalarge extent bythe
type ofmeasuring instrument that is
used and thecare exercised inusing
it.Figure 2:6shows anumber ofinstru-
ments used formaking measurements.
Because allmeasuring devices have limi-
tations, itfollows that allmeasurements
areapproximate and calculations based
onsuch measurements, although the

MEASUREMENT Sec. 1:3
mathematical operations aredone cor-
rectly, givenumbers asanswers thatare
notquite perfect. Thus numbers that
arederived bymeasurement arecalled
approximate numbers.
(h)Calculations
Theaim incalculations istoarrive
atananswer that isasaccurate aspos-
sible but that, atthesame time, does
notindicate more accuracy than that
ofthe least accurate measuring instru-
ment employed. Thus, ifthedimensions
ofarectangle are7.54cm.by3.81 cm.,
theproper area is28.7 sq.cm., not
28.7274 sq.cm.The latter number
expresses measurement with greater ac-
curacy than ispossible with themeans
atour disposal. The reasons will be
apparent after studying laterparagraphs
(page 15).
(c)Approximate Numbers
In allmeasurement, youmust first
decide what willbethelimits ofaccuracyofyourwork and then realize that a
possible error exists intheresult. Inorder
tomake this small, thepossible error
isnotpermitted toexceed one-half of
thesmallest unitemployed intheopera-
tion. Thus, intheprevious examples,
if1/8inch were thesmallest uniton
themeasuring instrument used, apos-
sible error of1/16 inchmore orless is
found intheanswer. Accordingly the
length oftheroom inpart (a)would be
between 14feet,15/16 inchand 15feet,
1/16 inchand thewidth ofthedoor
would bebetween 2915/16 and301/16
inches. Similarly, ifthepresent room
temperature isgiven as21.5°C., and
thethermometer ismarked offinto 0.1
degree units, thepossible error willbe
.05centigrade degrees and theactual
reading may bebetween 21.45°C. and
21.55°C. The reading 21.5°C. repre-
sents thetemperature asaccurately as
themeans ofmeasurement atour dis-
posal willpermit. Other examples follow:

Toallay thefear thatnaturally arises
over thepresence ofthispossible error,
letuscalculate what percent ofthe
whole itrepresents. Thepercentage er-
ror ispossible error divided bytheac-
cepted number times 100. Using the
firstmeasurement inthepreceding table
weget:
Thepercentage error =:

numbers contain anextremely small
error. Themore precise themeasuring
device is,thesmaller theunit ofmea-
surement will be.The smaller theunit
ofmeasurement is,thesmaller thepos-
sible error willbe.
(d)How toDeal with
Approximate Numbers
1.Significant Digits
When performing ameasurement, only
those numbers inthemeasurement that
arecertain, likethe15feet,30inches,
21.5°C. ofprevious paragraphs, are
recorded. The digits inthese numbers
13
Chap. 2 MECHANICS
arecalled thesignificant digits inthe
result, there being two inthe firsttwo
numbers above, and three inthethird.
Mathematicians have laiddown certain
rules toguide usinworking with them.
They areasfollows:
1.Allthedigits from 1to9including
any zeros between them orafter
them aresignificant digits.
2.The position ofthedecimal isdis-
regarded indetermining thenumber
ofsignificant digits.
3.The zeros preceding the first digit
arenotsignificant.

Where anumber like600 iscorrect
toone significant digit, itshould be
written as6X10^.Toexpress itas
600 indicates three significant digits.
Similarly, thedistance from theearth
tothesun iscorrect toonlytwo signi-
ficant digits and should bewritten
93X10®rather than 93,000,000 miles.3.Rounding offApproximate
Numbers
Anumber like thevalue ofpi(tt),
3.14159, iscorrect to6significant digits.
Itmaybemade consistent withmeasure-
ments having fewer than sixsignificant
digits bytheprocess ofrounding-off.
This means dropping the necessary

CHAPTER 3 DENSITY AND
SPECIFIC GRAVITY
I;5MEANING OFDENSITY
Inordinary conversation weoften say
that one substance is“heavier” than
another, e.g., iron is“heavier” than
aluminum. Obviously wecannot mean
thatanygiven piece ofiron isheavier
than every piece ofaluminum, butrather
that forpieces ofequal size, theiron
would betheheavier. Inscience weuse
theterm density toexpress thephysical
difference implied intheabove everyday
statement, that is,wesaythatironhasa
greater density thanaluminum. Density
isdefined asthemass ofaunitvolume
ofasubstance. Themethod ofdeter-
mining density isdescribed inchapter 5,
experiments 1,2and 3.
Instating densities thenumerical
measure must always beaccompanied
bysuitable units, e.g.,gm.per c.c., lb.
percu. ft., etc.,according tothe units;
inwhich themassandvolume ofthe
substance havebeenmeasured. Itshould
further benoted that thenumerical
value ofthedensity ofanygiven sub-
stance willdepend onthesystem of
units used. Thus, since onegram of
water (at itsmaximum density) occu-
pies avolume ofonecubic centimetre
(Sec. 1:2), thedensity ofwater intheG.G.S, system ofunits is1gm.per c.c.
IntheF.P.S. system, however, acu. ft.
ofwater isfound toweigh 62.5 ib.
(approx.), andhence the density of
water inthissystem ofunits will be
expressed as62.5 lb.percu. ft.Densi-
ties (ingm.per c.c.) ofvarious sub-
stances aregiven inthetableonpage 21.

Research Scientist Determining theDensity ofaSubstance byComparison with
Standard Density Floats Suspended inaSolution ofKnown Density.
Wehave previously defined mass as
thequantity ofmatter inabody. Ac-
cording tomodern theory, matter is
comprised ofmolecules, themolecules
ofanygiven substance being identical
toeach other (Sec. Ill:2).Hence,
differences indensity between various
substances (Fig. 3:1), aredue tothe
relative masses oftheir molecules as
well astotheir spatial arrangement.
Variations inthedensity ofagiven
substance aredue tochanges which vary
thecloseness ofpacking ofthemolecules.I:6DENSITY OFWATER
Itisfrequently said that thedensity
ofwater is 1gm. per c.c.However,
liquids, like solids and gases, expand
when heated andcontract when cooled
withnochange whatever inmass. They
therefore have different densities at
different temperatures.
Careful experiments toshow changes

I :7MEANING OFSPECIFIC GRAVITY
Formany purposes, instead ofden-
sity, itisfound more convenient touse
thedensity ofasubstance relative to
that ofwater. The relationship soob-
tained iscalled the specific gravity of
thesubstance. Itmaybecalculated in
thefollowing way:
g^_density ofthesubstance
density ofwater
-„ mass ofunitvolume ofthesubstance
o.o.—
mass ofunitvolume ofwater
gg_mass ofanyvolume ofthesubstance
mass ofanequal volume ofwater
Thus specific gravity isaratioandno

Further, itmust beevident that the

IntheC.G.S. system thedensity of

system, density and specific gravity are
numerically equal. Thetwotenns arenotinterchangeable, however, although

CHAPTER 4 BUOYANCY
I :10INTRODUCTION TOBUOYANCY
Weare allfamiliar with thefactthat
things seem lighter under water. Those
ofuswhohave helped tobuild adock
know thatalarge stone which canonly

watermay beraised quite easily when
under water. Similarly, wefind that

ananchor becomes heavier onemerging
from thewater. Ingeneral then, bodies
immersed inwater (orinany fluid) ap-
pear tolosesome oftheir weight. This
is,ofcourse, due tothefluid exerting
abuoyant force orliftonthem.
Thereason why fluids exert abuoyantforce willbeapparent after aconsid-
eration oftheforces thatwater exerts
onanobject immersed init(Fig.4 :1).
Thewater exerts adownward pressure
upon thetopsurface oftheobject, and
anupward pressure upon thebottom.
Because thebottom oftheobject isdeep-
erinthe liquid than isthe top,and
because pressure increases with depth,
theupward pressure upon thebottom
surface willexceed thedownward pres-
sureupon thetopsurface. There will,
therefore, beanetupward pressure upon
theblock. Itisthisupward force that
accounts fortheapparent lightness of
anobject when immersed inthewater.
Thesame principle applies toallbodies
immersed inanyliquid orgas.
Archimedes (287-212 b.g.), aGreek
mathematician and inventor, was the
first tostudy thebuoyancy ofliquids and
toenunciate animportant principle con-
nected therewith. The story istold that
Hiero, king ofSyracuse, had sent his
jeweller aknown mass ofgold tobemade
intoanewcrown. When thecrown was
delivered andtested itwasfound tohave
theright weight, butthere wasasus-
picion thatsome silver hadbeen sub-
stituted forgold intheinterior ofthe
crown. Consequently Archimedes was
commissioned todetermine whether or
notthecrown waspure gold, atthe
same time being instructed nottomar
thecrown inanyway.
Archimedes puzzled over thisproblem
atgreat length. Allthathehad towork
24
BUOYANCY Sec. 1:11
withwas thewell-known fact thatan
object iseasier to liftwhen immersed
inwater thanwhen onland.
One day ashehopped into his
bath, which hadbeen filled brimful of
water, hecaused aconsiderable quan-
titytooverflow onto thebrick floor,and
hewassuddenly struck bytheidea that
theweight helostonsubmerging was
equal tothat ofthewater which over-
flowed. Hewas soexcited bythis dis-
covery, sothestory goes, thatheran
home unclothed shouting, “Eureka!
Eureka!” (“Ihave found it! Ihave
found it!”)
Asyou study the principle that
Archimedes enunciated, see ifypucan
suggest theexperiment thatArchimedes
probably performed todetermine whether*
ornotthecrown waspure gold.
1:11 ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE
Theexperiment todemonstrate Archi-medes’ Principle (Chap. 5,Exp. 5,6)
should bestudied carefully inconjunc-
tionwith thefollowing statements:
1.When abody isimmersed inaliquid
itdisplaces some oftheliquid to
make room for itself. Note that the
volume ofthe liquid displaced is
equal tothevolume oftheobject.
2.Thebody isbuoyed upbytheliquid
and therefore seems toweigh less
than itdoes inair.
3.This lossinweight isexactly equal
totheweight ofthe liquid dis-
placed (Fig. 4:2).
Archimedes’ Principle, therefore, may
bestated asfollows: Anobject, when
immersed inaliquid, loses inapparent
weight anamount equal totheweight
oftheliquid displaced.
oranalternative statement is:
Thebuoyant force ofafluid (liquid or
gas)upon anobject immersed in it, is
equal totheweight ofthefluid displaced.
Examples
1.Arectangular piece ofmetal, 15cm.long, 6cm.wideand 3cm.thick,
weighs 2700 gm. inair.Find itsweight when immersed inwater.
Weight ofobject inair=2700gm.
Volume ofobject =15X6X3=270 c.c.
Volume ofwater displaced =270 c.c.
Weight ofwater displaced =270gm.(Density ofwater=1gm./cc.)
Weight ofobject inwater=2700—270(Archimedes’ Principle)=2430gm.
25
Chap. 4 MECHANICS
2.Find theweight oftheobject inexample 1,ifitwereimmersed in
carbon tetrachloride (S.G.=1.60).
Weight ofobject inair=2700gm.
Volume ofobject=15X6X3=270 c.c.
Volume ofcarbon tetrachloride displaced=270 c.c.
1c.c.ofcarbon tetrachloride weighs 1.60gm.(S.G.=1.60)
Weight ofcarbon tetrachloride displaced=270X1.60=432gm.
Weight ofobject incarbon tetrachloride =2700—432
(Archimedes’ Principle)
=2268gm.
Archimedes’ Principle isused fortheaccurate determination ofthe
specific gravity ofsolids andliquids (Chap. 5,Exp. 7-9).
I:12PRINCIPLE OFFLOTATION
Archimedes’ Principle applies tofloat-
ingbodies aswell astothose which are
submerged inafluid.When abody is
floating inaliquid itappears tolose all
itsweight, ascanbeshown bylowering
intowater ablock ofwood, suspended
byathread from thehook ofaspring
balance (Fig. 4:3). Asthewood settles
more deeply into thewater thereading
ofthespring balance decreases until,
when thewood isfloating, itrecords zero
weight. The entire weight ofthewood
isnowbeing supported bytheupthrust
ofthewater, thisbeing equal tothe
weight ofwater displaced. We thus
have, forfloating bodies, thePrinciple
ofFlotation, which states thattheweightofafloating object isequal totheweight
ofthefluid (liquid orgas) itdisplaces
when floating. Afairly heavy object
will ofcourse sinklower intheliquid
inwhich itisfloating than willalighter
object. Ineither case thesubmerged
portion has displaced anamount of
liquid equal totheweight ofthefloating
object.
This statement isembraced inArchi-
medes’ Principle, i.e.,abodywhich floats
has lost itswhole weight. (Remember
that this loss isanapparent one, not
real.The pulloftheearth onthefloat-
ingbody isstillthesame.) Experimental
proof for this Principle issupplied in
Chap. 5,Exp. 10.

common type ofhydrometer consists of
acylindrical stem, graduated orcon-
taining apaper scale, anexpansion of
thestem called the float, and abulb
weighted withmercury orlead shot, the
ballast, tomake itfloat upright (Fig.

ofthehydrometer.

forliquids lighter than water have a

with aspecific gravity of1.000 atthe

Now float itinsome liquid whose

note, theweight ofliquid displaced is
equal totheweight ofthehydrometer,
namely, 15gm.That is,themass of

Itfollows, therefore, that the specific

amples are afewwhich show how
important these principles are:
(a)Ships
Evenwhen itshull ismade ofiron
(density 7.9gm.per c.c.) aship floats
onwater because, being hollow, its
average density islessthan that ofwater.
When itislaunched itwill sink tothe
level atwhich theweight ofthewater it
displaces isequal totheentire weight of
theship,andhence themeaning ofthe
term “displacement”. Aship like the
Queen Elizabeth, of85,000 tons displace-
ment, displaces 85,000 tons ofsea-water
when afloat. Toensure that itdoes not
sinkmore deeply than issafe inthe
water, each shiphasasafe-loading line,
known asthePlimsoll line (Fig. 4:8)
painted on itshull. Actually there are
several such lines, toallow forregional
and seasonal variations. These marks
indicate thedepth towhich theship
maybesafely loaded under thedifferent
conditions.
(b)Submarines
Asubmarine isavessel with acylin-
drically shaped enclosed hull fitted with
ballast tanks atbowand sternandwith
smaller tanks oneither sideamidships.
Inorder tosubmerge, thesubmarine
allows water toenter these tanks until
thetotal weight oftheboatand ballast
isnearly asgreat asthat ofthewater
itcan displace. Thesubmarine isnow
in“diving trim” and,byaproper useof
horizontal ordiving rudders, itcansub-
merge completely andmaintain itsdepth
below thesurface. Inorder toresurface,
itforces thewater outofitsballast tanks
withcompressed air.This action reduces
itstotal weight until, when theweight
islessthan theupthrust, theship rises.
(c)Floating Docks
When thehull ofagreat liner isto
beserviced andreconditioned, afloating
dock isused tolift itoutofthewater.Thisdock consists, essentially, ofalarge

ments which canbefilled withwater to

sink thedock toasufficient depth for
theship tobedrawn into itbytugs.The
water isthenblown outofthe-tanks by
compressed air,andthedock rises, lifting
theshipwith it(Fig. 4:9).
(d)Balloons
When weapply Archimedes’ Principle
toair,weseethat abody inairwill
experience aforce ofbuoyancy equal to
theweight ofair itdisplaces. Abal-
loon will rise iftheweight ofthe air
displaced isgreater than theweight of
theballoon envelope and itsattachments.
Itwillcontinue torise until itreaches
alevel ofmore rarified airwhere the
weight ofthe airdisplaced isequal to
thatoftheballoon.
The first balloons, built in1783, em-
ployed hotairforupthrust, having open
bottoms withburning braziers slung un-
derneath them, butbyAugust ofthe
same year theFrench scientist Charles
had sentupthe firstballoon tobefilled
with thenewly discovered gas,hydrogen.
Two years later atripwasmade from
France toEngland insuch aballoon,
motive power being provided byoars.
Modern balloons aremade ofagas-
tight silkfabric fitted with valves. In-
creased height isobtained byreleasing
water orsand ballast, while thedescent
30
BUOYANCY Sec. 1:14
isbrought about byslowly releasing the
gasfrom theenvelope. Then, since at-
mospheric pressure decreases with height,
thegas inside theballoon expands as
itrises (inaccordance with Boyle’s law)
andthusthere isdanger that theballoon
will burst atgreat heights. For this
reason, inballoon ascents tohigh alti-
tudes, theenvelope isnot filled tocapa-
city atground level.
The greatest height reached bya
manned balloon, 72,395 feet(over I3/2
miles) wasmade byStevens andAnder-
son,twoUnited StatesArmy officers, at
Rapid City, South Dakota, in1935.
Their tripwasmade inatightly-sealed
hollow metal sphere attached toahuge
helium-filled balloon.
(e)Weather orSounding Balloons
Themain useofhydrogen balloons
today istocollect information about the
upper atmosphere formeteorological pur-poses. These sounding balloons, asthey
are called, expand asthey rise, until
they spring aleak orburst, when the
meteorological instruments which they
carry areparachuted toearth. Tempera-
ture, pressure andhumidity reports at
various altitudes areautomatically sent
toweather stations byradio transmitters.
Analysis ofthereadings haveshown that
sounding balloons have reached heights
of25miles ormore.
(f)Airships
Anairship isaballoon builtonalight

and steered byrudders. The design of
thistype ofcraft developed rapidly in
theearly decades ofthis century. Al-
though long flights were successfully
made inthese ships, aseries ofdisasters
resulting from theeasewithwhich they
caught fire, hascaused their further
development tobeabandoned.

CHAPTER 6 PRODUCTION AND
TRANSMISSION OFSOUND
11:1INTRODUCTION
From earliest childhood ourearsgrow
.accustomed tosounds about us :firstthe
sound ofourmother’s voice, then the
:sounds ofhome, ofnature, and the
busy world. Our consideration oftheir
nature rarely goes further than calling
thesounds wedislike noises, andsome
ofthemore pleasant ones music. These,
Ihowever, areoften subjective definitions,
1ascanbeseen from the fact that a
I“hot-rodder” may drive formiles inhis
Iunmuffled carand think thesound it
ismaking is“music”, while hewillhur-
riedly turn offtheradio because ofthe
“noise” Beethoven ismaking.
Man, infact, hasbeen interested in
inventing devices formaking music and
[noises formuch longer than ininvesti-
gating thenature ofsound. References
Itomusical instruments intheOldTesta-
Iment dateback to4000 b.c.Remember
Ithestory ofJoshua and thewalls of
!Jericho. Yet,although Aristotle andthe
early philosophers knew something ofthe
physical nature ofsound, itisonly in
the lastfour orfivehundred years that
[afuller understanding of ithasbeen
jgained.
iTheword sound hasbeen used fre-
quently already, butnoeffort has sofarbeenmade todefine it.One defini-
tion calls itthesensation that results
when theauditory nerve isstimulated,
while another refers tothe physical
causes ofthissensation, interms ofthe
three necessary agencies foranysound:
asource, amedium andareceiver. Itis
thissecond definition ofsound which
willbeourconcern inthis unit.
11:2THEORIGIN OFSOUND
When wering abell,bow astring,
orstrike atuning-fork, andbring each
intocontact with alight object such as
apith ball, theobject moves away asif
being struck regularly (Fig. 6:1). Some
demonstrators may prefer totouch the
sounding body tosome water andnote
Fig. 6:1Sounding Bodies Vibrate.
thesplash andwaves setup.This is
ample proof that thesounding body is
vibrating, i.e.,moving toand fro. It
may beconcluded thatsound always
49
Chap. 6 SOUND
originates inarapidly vibrating body.
Only sufficiently rapid vibrations cause
sound, butsome vibrations, whether or
notthey emit sound, have other effects,
such asthe destruction ofbuildings,
bridges, orparts ofmoving machinery.
Totakeone instance, thevibration set
upbyabody oftroops marching would
besufficient todestroy some bridges and
sotroops marching across them have to
break step. Obviously the study of
vibratory motion isone ofgreat im-
portance.
11:3ASTUDY OFVIBRATORY
MOTION
(a)ThePendulum and
Transverse Vibrations
Asimple device fordemonstrating
vibrations isthependulum (Chap. 10,
Exp.1).This consists ofaweight, called
thebob, attached tothefreeend ofa
vertical cord, theother endofwhich is
securely attached toasupport (Fig.

6:2).When theweight isdrawn aside
andallowed toswing, itwillbe-“seen
that thependulum swings back “and
forth inaregular manner and that itmoves about thesame distance oneither
sideofthepoint ofrestormean position.
Theadvantage ofusing apendulum
tostudy vibrations isthat theaction is
slowenough tobenoted inevery de-
tail.Forexample, ifwedraw thebob
aside and let itmove toand froonce
thependulum will have performed
one vibration orcycle. Most objects
would vibrate too fast toallow this to
beseen. The horizontal displacement
thatthebobundergoes oneither sideof
itsnatural restposition istheamplitude
ofthevibration. This isthedestructive
element ofvibratory motion that affects
rigidand brittle components ofbuildings,
bridges, machinery and the like.More-
over, weshall see later (Sec. 11:11)
that itaffects theloudness ofsound. To
themovement ofthependulum, which
isobviously atright angles tothemean
position, isascribed theterm transverse
vibration. Although there areother kinds
ofvibrations, youwillrecognize thiskind
insome oftheobjects used todemon-
strate theorigin ofsound.
Counting thenumber ofvibrations in
agiven time, say30seconds, enables us
todetermine twoother important prop-
erties ofvibrations. Ifwecalculate the
number ofvibrations persecond, we
know thefrequency ofvibration. Dif-
ferences inthefrequencies ofmusical
notes account fordifferences inpitch of
thesounds (Sec. 11:12). Ifwedetermine
thetime inseconds required forone
vibration, weknow theperiod ofvibra-
tion.You willdiscover that allpendu-
lums ofthesame length willhave the
same period. Itisforthisreason that
thependulum isfrequently used in
physics asatiming device. For that
reason also, itistheprimary component
oflarge clocks. Were youtoexperiment
withpendulums ofdifferent lengths, the
period ofashort onewould belessthan
that ofalong one. Itisforthisreason

Fortunately the vibrations are slow

enough toenable ustoobserve allthe
details asinthependulum (Chap. 10,
Exp. 2).Another demonstration may bear-
ranged using along rnetal rod,clamped
at itscentre, having apith ball in
contact with oneend asinFig. 6:4.
When thehalf oftherodfarthest from
thepith ball isstroked with achamois
coated with resin, ashrill sound is
emitted. Meanwhile the pith ball is
displaced inthedirection oftheaxis of
therod,thusshowing longitudinal vibra-
tions, although these aretoorapid to
beseen indetail. These examples indi-
cate that longitudinal vibrations are
characterized bymotion backand forth
along thelength ofthevibrating body.
11:4MEDIA FORTHETRANSMISSION
OFSOUND
Theneed foramaterial medium for
thetransmission ofsound isstudied in
Chap. 10,Exp. 3.There itwillbefound
that astheair isremoved from thebell-
jarinwhich there isavibrating bell
(Fig. 6:5), thesound gradually becomes
fainter. The bell isheard again when
air isreintroduced intothebell- jar.Since
OfTHEUNIVERSITY
OfALBERTA51
Chap. 6 SOUND
wecould seethevibrating bellthrough-
outtheentire experiment butcould not
hear thesound when there wasnoair
present, weconclude thatsound, unlike
light, cannot travel through avacuum.
Sounds can alsobeconveyed through
liquids andmost solids. Thus thenoise
oftheengines ofasubmarine canbe
picked upbyunderwater microphones,
and thesound ofvibrating telegraph
wires canbeclearly heard byanear
pressed against atelegraph post.
11:5WAVE MOTION
(a)Transverse Waves
Thedisturbances setupbyavibrating
body arepropagated intheform of
waves inthemedium (Chap. 10,Exp.
4).Awavemaybedefined asadistur-
bance ofanykindwhich travels with-
outchange ofform andwithout the
medium moving bodily with it.Simple
examples ofwaves aretobeseenwhen
oneendofatautrope isjerked orwhen
astone isthrown intoapondandmakes
ripples onthesurface. Waves produced
inthisway areknown astransverse
waves, since thedisturbances inthe
medium areperpendicular ortransverse
tothedirection ofpropagation ofthe
waves. The ripples onwater canbe
seen totravel outwards from thecentre
ofthedisturbance, butacork floating
onthesurface willexecute anup-and-
down motion without moving awayfrom ortowards thepoint oforigin
ofthewaves. Again, ifpart ofourrope
were chalk-marked, thispartwould be
seen asawhite lineperpendicular tothe
length oftheropewhen the latter was
vibrated atoneendtosetupatrain of
waves along it.Electromagnetic waves
(Sec.IV :38) ,which include light waves,
arealso transverse incharacter.
Fig.6:6shows thedisplacements of
the particles ofamedium transmitting
atransverse wave. Particles atthecrests
(B,F,etc.) ofthewave areundergoing
amaximum displacement upwards, those
atthebottom ofthetroughs (D,H,etc.)
amaximum displacement downwards.

(b)Longitudinal Waves
Sound waves differ from those de-
scribed above inthat the particles of
themedium aredisplaced from their
mean positions backwards andforwards
along the line oftravel ofthewave
motion. Such waves areknown as
longitudinal waves, andmay beillus-
trated byreference toFig. 6:8. There
wehave acoilspring stretched between
twosupports (S,Si).Apiece ofcloth
istiednear itscentre. When several coils
ofthespring aresqueezed together a
compression, orcondensation (C) is
formed. When the coils are released,
their elasticity causes them toreturn to
their normal position. Themomentum
soproduced causes them tomove past
thisposition, thereby forming astretched
region orrarefaction (R).
Astudy ofthejerking ofthecloth to
and froalong thelength ofthespring
will giveample proof ofwhat ishap-
pening. Itwillnowbegood practice to
draw alongitudinal wave-train inacoil
spring and label amplitude, particles in
thesame phase, andonewave-length.
Longitudinal waves arealways charac-
terized bycondensations andrarefactions.

Icord being tied totheclapper, ora
special vibrator asshown inFig.6:11 (c)
may beemployed. For reasons tobe
discussed later, thelength ofthecord
isadjusted until ittakes theformshown
inthe figure. The hazy oval regions
where displacement ofthecord isgreat-
Iestarecalled loops. The points ofquiet
aswell as tlieends where reflection
occurs arecalled nodes. Itmight be
imagined thataloopwould occur where
thecordmeets thevibrator but,inreality,
itheamplitude ofthevibrator issosmall
Icompared tothat ofthecord that it
jmust beconsidered tobeanode. In
!anycasesome reflection occurs there,
rThereason foradjusting thelength of
Ithecord israther too difficult tobe
jexplained here. Flowever, thismuch can
!besaid, that thewave-length ofthe
idisturbance depends onthe tension
(caused bytheweight) and the fre-
quency ofthesource. Since each loop
ishalfawave-length andthere must be
awhole number ofloops inthecord,
thelength must beadjusted toaccom-
modate awhole number ofloops.
Anexamination ofFig.6:12 willhelp
ustounderstand thephenomenon. The
wave composed ofdashes isproceeding
tothe right, thedotted one tothe left.
They have thesame amplitude and
wave-length. The solid line istheresult-
antoftheformer two.
Atthe start letusassume that the
waves arecompletely outofphase asin
(a).Weknow that the result willbe
aline ofundisturbed particles. One-
quarter ofaperiod later (b),each will
have shifted one-quarter wave-length but
inopposite directions. -The waves will
beinphasenowand willreinforce each
other. For this reason, the resultant
haswider amplitude than either ofthe
original waves. Diagrams (c), (d),and
(e),maybeexplained asabove exceptthat thephase isdifferent after each
quarter vibration. Thecombined effect
isshown in(f).
Examination ofthediagrams reveals
that points 2,4,6,8,10which are
one-half awave-length apart arealways
atrestandhence constitute thenodes.
Points 1,3,5,7,9move from rest toa
point ofmaximum displacement onone
sidethenback through thepoint ofrest
toapoint ofmaximum displacement on
theother and return. These arethe
loops.
Thus standing waves consist ofnodes
and loops. The distance between suc-
cessive nodes orloops isone-half a
wave-length. These waves willbeuse-
fulinunderstanding vibrations instrings

ofthesound ashort period after it
hasbeen produced. Forests, clifTs, hill-
sides, etc. will all reflect sound and
cause theformation ofechoes. Ifthere
areanumber ofreflecting surfaces at
different distances from thesource, a
series ofrepetitions ofthesound signal,
each following theother, willbereceived.
These areknown asmultiple echoes, and
they areheard, forexample, when an
Alpine horn isblown amidst anumber
ofmountain peaks.
The reflection ofsounds may have
unpleasant results inauditoria that are
notproperly constructed. The sounds

the effects ofonesound have notdied

resulting jumble ofsounds isknown as
reverberation.
Further reference toreflection of
sound willbemade inthenext section
and insection 11:32.
11:8THEVELOCITY OFSOUND
(a)Methods ofMeasuring
1.ByDirect Measurement
The early experiments todetermine
thevelocity ofsound inair,made inthe
late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries, were based onestimating the
difference intime forthelightand thesound totravel toanobserver from a
cannon firedsome distance away (Fig.
6:15). Since thespeed oflight isvery
great (186,000 miles persecond), the
flash oftheexplosion isseen almost
instantaneously. Hence thetime elaps-
ingbetween anobserver seeing theflash
andhearing thereport oftheexplosion
may betaken asthetime needed for
thesound totravel themeasured distance
between thecannon and observer, and
thisenables thespeed ofsound tobe
calculated.
There aretwomain objections tothese
simple “flash-bang” experiments. Ifthere
isawind the result willbegreater or
lessthan thetrue value according to
whether thewind isblowing from the
cannon totheobserver orintheopposite
direction. Theother chief source oferror
isthe“reflex time” oftheobserver. Thus,
ifastop-watch isused insuch anex-
periment there isadifference between
theresponse time inseeing theflashand
starting thewatch, and hearing the
report andstopping it.This error varies
with different observers, andwith the
same individual from time totime, and
alsoeven with theloudness ofthesound.
Ifthecannon isonemilefrom theob-
server thesound will take about 5
seconds totravel thedistance, andhence
apersonal error of1/5second will in-
troduce anerror offourpercent inthe
final result.

The first accurate determination of
thespeed ofsound was carried outby
theFrench Academy in1738. Two
cannons were used, separated byadis-
tance ofabout 18miles toreduce the
error due tothe“reflex time”. Toelim-
inate the effect ofwind, timings were
taken (bymeans ofpendulums) inboth
directions and theaverage used tocal-
culate thespeed ofsound. The result
obtained was337metres per sec. at
6°G., or332metres per sec. at0°C.
Later experiments, carried out inthe
same way, butusing chronometers, ac-
curate toone-tenth ofasecond, gave a
mean result of331metres persec.at0°C.
2.ByEchoes
Ifasound signal isdirected toa
distant wall orobstacle anecho willbe
received some time later, thesound wave
having travelled twice thedistance be-
tween thewallandtheobserver during
the period. This suggests apossible
method ofmeasuring the velocity of
sound. For clear echoes, however, the
wall (orreflecting surface) should notbe
toofar distant, and this involves the
practical difficulty ofmeasuring very
short time-intervals. With awall 100
yards distant, forexample, theecho ofa
sound signal willbereceived onlyabout
one-half second later. This difficulty has
beenovercome byusing ametronome oranelectrically controlled tapper tosend
outasequence ofsound signals atregular
intervals. Thedistance ofthemetronome
from thewall isadjusted until theecho
ofone click isheard simultaneously
with thenext click. Thesound signal
hasclearly travelled toandfrom thewall
during theinterval between the clicks.
This time-interval isaccurately known,
and sothevelocity ofsound canbe
found. Itshould benoted that since
thesound signal hastotravel back along
itstrack thismethod automatically elim-
inates theeffect ofthewind.
Example
Ametronome was280 feetfrom the
wall and thetime interval between
clicks was1/2second.

(742.5 miles perhour at0°C.) and
more, hasbecome agreat testboth of
the skill ofoperation and theconstruc-
tion ofaircraft. When anadvancing

CHAPTER 7 CHARACTERISTICS OF
MUSICAL SOUNDS
11:10INTRODUCTION
(a)How aMusical Sound
Differs from aNoise
Aswehave seen, people arequick
toclassify thesounds they hear, aseither
musical sounds ornoises. Almost every-
one finds noises, liketheslamming ofa
door ortherumble ofmachinery un-
pleasant, andmusical sounds likethose
ofatuning-fork orviolin pleasant.
Wecan establish amore objective dif-
ference than thisbetween noise and
music. When anoscilloscope isused
tocompare thesound ofmachinery and
that ofatuning-fork, atrace similar

tothat inFig. 7:1results. Itisobvious
that themusical sound iscaused by
rapid regular (periodic) vibrations, whilethenoise istheresult ofirregular (non-
periodic) vibrations.
(b)How Musical Sounds Differ
from Each Other
Ifonetuning-fork isstruck lightly, and
another more vigorously, thesecond will
emit alouder sound. Sounds that differ
inloudness differ inintensity. Ifthe
sounds from twovibrating tuning-forks
with differing frequencies arecompared,
theforkwith thegreater frequency emits
the“higher” sound. Sounds that differ
in“highness” differ inpitch. Further,
ifthesounds ofavibrating tuning-fork
andavibrating string ofthesame fre-
quency arecompared, there isnodiffi-
culty inidentifying theorigin ofeach
sound. Sounds from different sources
may bedistinguished because they differ
inquality. Thus musical sounds differ
from each other inintensity, pitch and
quality. Itisthepurpose ofthischapter
tostudy these three characteristics fur-
ther.
11:11 THEINTENSITY OFSOUND
Ifabellthat isrung cannot beheard
atadistance, weknow thatwemay be
able tomake itheard bystriking it
harder. This issobecause striking with
greater force transfers more energy to
thevibrating body, increasing whatwe
callthesounds. This increases theam-
plitude (energy ofvibration) and gives
itagreater intensity. Ifthesound is
still inaudible, theother obvious thing
thatcanbedone tomake itheard is
63
Chap. 7 SOUND
toshorten the distance between the
source andthereceiver. Itmight seem
from thisthat there arejusttwofactors
affecting theintensity ofsound, namely
amplitude and distance, buttheexperi-
ence ofundersea workers incaissons and
diving-bells where theair isunder great
pressure, isthatquite ordinary sounds are
unexpectedly loud there. This greater in-
tensity ofthesound transmitted results
from thefact thatincreased pressure on
agascrowds themolecules closer and
increases thedensity ofthemedium. For
thesame reason, asiswellknown, sounds
transmitted bysolids and liquids are
louder thanwhen transmitted by air.
Thus, athird factor affecting intensity
ofsound isdensity ofmedium.
The particular laws governing the
intensity ofsound are:
1.The intensity ofsound varies directly
asthesquare oftheenergy ofvibra-
tion(amplitude) ofthesource.
2.The intensity ofsound varies in-
versely asthesquare ofthedistance
ofthereceiver from thesource.
3.The intensity ofsound increases
withanincrease inthedensity ofthe
transmitting medium.
The intensity ofsound ismeasured in
belsand decibels (deci—1/10), the
decibel being thefaintest sound thatcan
beperceived byanormal human ear.
Fig.7:2shows theamount ofnoise or
“noise level” indecibels inafewcom-
mon locations, for, likemusical sounds,
noises vary inintensity. Naturally,
noises areinevitable wherever there is
machinery, butunnecessary discomfort
canbeavoided bythenoise level being
measured and steps being taken toelim-
inate allunnecessary vibration. Noise
levels around machinery canbereduced
bytheuseofrubber mountings, mufflers
andthe like; walls and ceilings canbe
covered withsound-absorbent wallboard,
and air-ducts with sound-absorbent baf-fles, while neighbouring buildings can
beprotected bydouble windows. The

tionwasdoubled, thenumber oftaps
persecond (thefrequency) wasdoubled.
The second note, whose frequency is
twice asgreat, issaid tobeanoctave
higher than the first.Thus foranote of
high pitch tobesounded, thebodymust
bevibrating rapidly, whereas aslow rate
ofvibration produces anote oflowpitch.
Inshort, thepitch ofsound depends
onthefrequency. Thefrequency ofthe
sound produced may bedetermined by
applying theformula: frequency ofnote
produced (v.p.s.)=number ofteeth on
Savart’s wheelXspeed ofrotation in
revolutions persecond.
The limits offrequency fornotes of
audible pitch arefrom about 20 to20,000 v.p.s. fortheaverage ear (Fig.
7:4). Therange offrequencies used in
music isfrom about 30to5,000 v.p.s.,
thekeyboard ofapiano extending from
27to3,500 v.p.s.Aman’s speaking
voice embraces frequencies ranging be-
tween 100and150 v.p.s. approximately.
Extreme limits ofaudibility (for very
sensitive ears)maybetaken asextending
from 20to35,000 v.p.s. The lowest

11:13 THEDOPPLER EFFECT
When acarwith itshorn sounding
approaches apedestrian athigh speed,
thepitch ofthesound appears tobe
higher than thetrue pitch which the
driver hears (Fig. 7:5). After thecar
haspassed, thepitch appears tobelower
than thetrue pitch. Similar changes in
pitch occurwhen theorigin isstationary
andtheobserver moves past it.
Todetermine thecause, letustake
thecase oftheorigin approaching the
observer. Inany second, auniformnumber ofwave-fronts aresentoutand
they willbeauniform distance apart.
However, because theorigin isapproach-
ingtheobserver, there willbemore than
theusual number packed inagiven
space, i.e,,they willbecloser together
than before. Asaresult, more than the
normal number willbereceived bythe
observer inonesecond. This willcause
anapparent riseinthepitch ofthesound.
Thisphenomenon iscalled thedoppler
effect.

show that while thefrequency of256
v.p.s. isemitted by34.4cm. ofstring,twice thatfrequency isproduced byone-
half that length andfour times the fre-
quency byone-quarter that length. Other
possible results would bethatthree times
thefrequency isproduced byone-third
thelength, fivetimes thefrequency by
one-fifth, and soon.Thus we see, as
incolumn 3below, that theproduct of
frequency times thelength ofvibrating
string isconstant within the limits of
experimental error. Therefore, the fre-
quency ofthenoteproduced byavibrat-
ingstring varies inversely asitslength.

11:16HOWASTRETCHED STRING
VIBRATES
Wehave justconsidered thesimplest
mode ofvibration ofastretched string
wherein thestring vibrates asawhole.
There isaloop inthecentre with anode
ateachend (Sec. 11:6). When vibrat-
ingthus, thestring isemitting thenote
oflowest frequency, thefundamental.
However, the string may vibrate in
other ways toproduce notes ofhigher
frequency (Chap. 10,Exp. 8).
When the string vibrates inhalves,
thenote produced hastwice the fre-
quency ofthefundamental andone-half
thewave-length. This isthe firstover-tone or.second harmonic. When vibrat-
ing inthirds, quarters and fifths, the
frequencies produced arethree, fourand
fivetimes that ofthefundamental, and
thewave-lengths are one-third, one-
quarter andone-fifth ofthefundamental.
The notes arecalled thesecond over-
tone orthird harmonic and soon. Fig.
7:7shows somemodes ofvibration ofa
stretched string.
Weseethat astringmay vibrate in
parts, and asawhole aswell.When
itisvibrating inparts, thefrequency of
thenote isamultiple ofthat ofthe
fundamental and thenotes arecalled
theharmonics orovertones ofthestring.
Frequently these overtones accompany
thefundamental when that note is
sounded, and give quality tothesound
produced (Chap. 10,Exp. 9).Very
fewsources, ontheother hand, produce
thefundamental free ofovertones. The

tion will takeupthevibratory motion
andmove with increasing amplitude.
The others thathave different periodswillvibrate erratically, starting, stopping,
butnever accomplishing thepersistence
ofvibration referred toabove. Now,
when impulses from onebody affect
another having thesame period ofvibra-
tion, thesecond willbegin tovibrate with
increasing amplitude. Ifitisalready in
motion, theamplitude willbecome great-
er.This effect isknown asresonance
and willbevery valuable inexplaining
thephenomena that follow.
11:20RESONANCE INAIRCOLUMNS
That aircolumns canbesetinvibra-
tionandmade toproduce sounds ofa
definite pitch iswell illustrated bysuch
simple experiments asblowing across
empty test-tubes ofvarious lengths. Such
aircolumns have anatural period of
vibration depending ontheir length. If
thefluctuations ofpressure attheendof
thecolumn (caused byblowing) have
thesame period asthat oftheaircol-
umn, resonance willoccur. Thecolumn
willbeinastate ofviolent sympathetic
vibration, and astrong note will be
heard.

thetube isclosed atoneend, itiscalled
aclosed tube, while ifitisopen atboth

andararefaction asacondensation from

that reinforces thecondensation pro-
duced above theprong ofthefork. If
thelength ofthetube issuch that the

willgointothetubewhich tends torein-
force therarefaction already proceeding
downward. This process continues until
theairinthetube isvibrating withsuch
wide amplitude that itbecomes the
major source ofthesound heard. It
should beapparent that thesound trav-
elled twice thelength oftheclosed tube
during one-half vibration, andtherefore
thelength oftheclosed tube isequal to
one-quarter ofthewave-length.
(b)TheOpen Tube
Open tubes will also vibrate inre-
sonance with sources ofsound such as
tuning-forks. Ithasbeen found that
during onevibration thesound travels
twice thelength ofthetube, and there-
forethelength oftheopen tube isequal
toone-half ofthewave-length. Itwill
beevident, therefore, that theopen tube
that vibrates inresonance with atuning-
fork ofacertain frequency istwice the
length oftheclosed tube.

INAIRCOLUMNS
(a)Closed Tubes
Asexplained insection II:20(a), the
condensation travelled twice thelength
ofthetube during one-half avibration
oftheprong ofthetuning-fork. Hence,
sound must travel four times thelength
ofthetube during onevibration ofthe
prong. Since thedistance energy travels
during onevibration isonewave-length,
thewave-length ofsound must befour
times thelength oftheclosed tubewhich
isinresonance with thetuning-fork. In
actual practice, thetrue wave-length
must beaugmented by .3times the
diameter ofthetube (seenote) butfor
our purposes wemay disregard it.
Therefore, wave-length (/)ofsound=
4Xlength ofclosed tube (L)giving
resonance.

The sizeoftheaircolumn issuch that

ends facing each other. When onefork
isvibrated andthen silenced shortly af-
terwards, asound ofthesame pitch is
stillheard (Chap. 10,Exp. 11.) Itis
found tooriginate from theother fork.
This response ofonebody tothesoundwaves caused bythevibrations ofanother
iscalled sympathetic vibrations. When a

prongs ofone fork itsfrequency isal-
tered. Iftheabove experiment were

Vibrations from theforkcause forced

sequence ofevents asabove, but inre-

CHAPTER 9 APPLICATIONS
OFSOUND
^I! :26THEVOICE
!Of allsources ofsound thevoice is
jthemost wonderful. The vocal cords
(c) inthelarynx (Fig. 9:1) aretwo
elastic membranes whose thickness, length
and tension affect thepitch inresponse
tothewill oftheperson and inkeeping
with thematurity andsexoftheindivi-
dual. Air (a)from dielungs(1)pass-ingbetween thesemembranes setsthem
invibration inaway similar toblowing
between thestrands ofastretched elas-
ticband. The faster theairmoves, the
greater isthe intensity ofthesound
produced. The particular quality ofthe
sound depends onresonance inthecavi-
tiesofthemouth (m)and (n). Varia-
tions arecaused bymuscles altering
the sizeandshape ofthese cavities. In
themouth, thetongue (t), inlarge
measure, makes themajor changes.
11:27 THEEAR
The ear isthemost wonderful sound
receiver thatcanbeimagined. Itcon-
sists ofthree parts: theouter ear, the
middle ear,and theinner ear.Sounds
arecollected bythepinna (Fig. 9:2)and
directed into theearcanal totheear-
drum. Theear-drum consists ofathin
(3/1000 inch thick) tightly stretched
membrane that issetinvibration bythe
sound waves and serves asthegateway
tothemiddle ear.
Within themiddle ear there are
three bonesnamed because oftheir shape,
thehammer, theanvil and thestirrup.
Thehammer isincontact with theear-
drum, thestirrup with theovalwindow
leading totheinner ear,and theanvil
connects thetwo sothat thevibrations
oftheear-drum aretransmitted tothe
inner ear.Themiddle ear isjoined to
thethroat bytheeustachian tube, the
purpose ofwhich istoequalize theair
pressure oneither side oftheear-drum.
Chap. 9 SOUND
This adjustment ofpressure canbefelt
when motoring inhilly country.
The inner earcontains aspirally-
shaped organ, thecochlea, containing a
fluid which isagitated when theoval
window vibrates. Movement inthisfluid
willcause hair-like projections tovibrate,
transmitting small nerve impulses through
theauditory nerve tothebrain.
Inaddition tothecochlea, theinner
earcontains another organ known as
thesemicircular canals, which isasso-
ciated with posture andbalance.
11:28 MUSICAL SCALES
The story oftheevolution oftheexist-
ingmusical scale isalongand interest-
ingone.The scalewhich givesmaximum
pleasure tous isone inwhich the fre-
quencies ofthenotes areinthesimpleratios shown (page 83). This scale is
known asthediatonic scale, which onthe
tonic sol-fa corresponds tothenotes doh,
ray,me, fah, soh, lah, te,doh, ormore
familiarly perhaps, C,D,E,F,G,A,
B,C'.
The first noteonthescale iscalled
thetonic, andthelastnote, oftwice the
frequency ofthe first, theoctave. The
number ofthenote (counting from the
tonic) defines amusical interval onthe
scale; thus theinterval fromCtoDis
asecond, thatfromCtoEathird,
and soon.These intervals correspond
respectively tofrequency ratios of
9/D_288\ 5/E_

between major andminor tones aretoo
large formusical requirements and ac-
cordingly intermediate notes areinserted,
known assharps and flats. These arethe

tweenCandD,forexample, beingC

aninterval of

Anote isflattened when lowered byan
interval of
24 24—,e.g.,Db=—X288=276.5 v.p.s.

Thus onthediatonic scale CjfandDb
are not exactly equal infrequency.
Further practical difficulties arise with
thediatonic scalewhen changing from
key tokey—aprocess known asmodu-
lation. Thus inthekeyofD(the scale
obtained usingDasthetonic) itwillbe
seen that intervals obtained using the
white notes ofthepiano occur inadif-
ferent sequence (minor tone, semitone,
major tone, . ..)from those obtained
when using thekey ofC(major tone.

correct this inallthevarious keys the
number of“black” notes required would
bevery large indeed. Thiswould make
keyed instruments such asthepiano and
organ very difficult toplay, although
with theviolin and thehuman voice,
where acontinuous range offrequencies
ispossible, there isnodifficulty inpro-
ducing thenotes required.
The difficulty isovercome with instru-
ments offixed pitch byadopting a
scale ofequal temperament orthechro-
matic scale (Fig. 9:3) inwhich the
differences intheintervals ofthediatonic
scale are abolished, theoctave being
divided intotwelve equal semitone inter-
valseach ofwhich equals1.059, e.g.,—= =r1.059.

inevitably present ininstruments offixed

reference tothetables willshow that a
chord ofthethree notes C,E,G,which
isknown asamajor triad, does not
have exactly thedesired frequency ratio

ever, inspite ofthisimperfection, this
scale meets alltherequirements admir-
ably.

11:29 MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
(a)Stringed Instruments
The reader willbeable tosuggest an
extensive listofthese (Fig. 9:4). All
!hav'e asounding-box orboard overwhich
oneormore strings arestretched. This
ismade tovibrate atthesame frequency
asthevibrating strings togive greater
'intensity ofsound. The frequencies of
thenotes emitted bythestrings arede-
,termined bytheir lengths, tensions, dia-
Imeters, and densities. Some instruments,
:e.g., thebanjo-like group, have afret-
board towhich the string ispressed,
jthuspre-determining thelength required
foracertain note. Those oftheviolin
jgroup have nofretsand theperformer
:must relyonhiseartoobtain thedesired
Inotewhen hepresses and vibrates the
jstring. Inthepiano, there isastring of
Icertain length, diameter, tension and
!'density foreach note. Allstringed in-struments produce notes with one or
more overtones, theirnumber depending
onthemanner ofvibrating thestring
andtheplace where itisbowed, picked,
orstruck.
(b)Wind Instruments
These include thepipeandreed or-
gans, thewood-winds and thebrass in-
struments (Fig. 9:5). They involve a
means ofvibrating aresonant aircolumn
either oftheopen orclosed variety. In
some the aircolumn isoffixed length
and inothers itmaybevaried bymeans
ofvalves orasliding telescoping device.
The closed pipe orflute type ofpipe
ofanorgan ispictured inFig. 9:6(a).
Compressed air(A) enters thespace
(C), isforced through the slit(S)and,
onstriking the lip(L), causes periodic
variations inpressure. Thelength ofthe
pipe isadjusted sothat itresonates with
these and gives outamusical tone, in-
cluding overtones. Being aclosed pipe.

theovertones whose frequencies areodd-
numbered multiples ofthefundamental.
Owing tothegreater number ofhigher
overtones obtained with open pipes,
organs generally contain that kind, but
they have thedisadvantage ofbeing
twice aslong foragiven note.
Anorgan pipe ofthereed-type is
pictured inFig. 9:6(b). Here air(A)
enters ametal-covered chamber (C)
containing thestem ofthepipe (S)with
thereed (R).The note isdetermined
bythereedand the aircolumn serves
togive resonance and improve the
quality ofthenote.
Instruments such asthefluteand pic-
coloareliketheflute-type oforgan pipe.
Different notes aremade byopening
holes along thelength oftheaircolumn.
The saxophone, bassoon, clarinet, and
oboe useareed tosettheaircolumn in
vibration, and thepitch isvaried by
opening and closing holes tovary the
length ofthiscolumn. Inbrass instru-ments the lips oftheperformer actas
adouble reed. Differences inpitch are
produced bychanging thelength ofair
column with “valves” asinthecornet
and similar instruments. This isac-
complished by sliding the telescopic
U-shaped part ofthetube inorout as
inthetrombone, orbyover-blowing to
produce theovertones asinthebugle.
Allmusical instruments require fre-
quent tuning due tomechanical defects
orchanges intemperature. Temperature
affects notonly thelengths ofthestrings
instringed instruments butthefrequency
ofaresonant aircolumn. The latter
may beunderstood when werecall that
thevelocity ofsound inairchanges with
thetemperature. SinceV—nland Iis
constant, thenchanges inVcause acor-
responding change inn.
(c)Drums
There areseveral types ofdrums used
inbands andorchestras (Fig. 9:7). The
bassandsnare drums and thetympani

used togive a“beat” tothemusic and
certain other effects. The latter istuned
during amusical number togiveasound
oflow pitch inharmony with theor-
chestra. Ineach, thevibrations ofthe
head areamplified through forced vibra-
tions ofthewhole instrument.
(d)The Electric Organ
Electric organs arewithout pipes or
aircolumns. Thesounds areproduced
electrically byvarious means. Inthe
Hammond Organ (Fig. 9:8), aniron
“tone wheel” revolving near amagnet in
acoil ofwire generates alternating cur-
rents inthe coilwhich, after they are
amplified, give rise tosound inan
amplifier. Many ofthese arerequired to
give thewhole range offrequencies.y 1

11:31 THEREPRODUCTION OFSOUND
ThePhonograph was invented by
Edison in1877.Hespoke into atube
which activated asharp needle whose
vibrations cutastraight groove ofvary-
ingdepth inasheet oftin-foil. Onthe
“play-back’' another needle followed the
groove and these up-and-down move-
ments were transmitted toadiaphragm
which settheairbehind itinvibration.
These early records were cylindrical.
Later improvements suggested byAlex-
ander Graham Bell, and others, in-
cluded the use ofawax recording
material, adisc-typerecord andagroove
ofconstant depth which wavered from
side toside, instead ofastraight groove
ofvarying depth.
Asimple diagram ofthegrooves on
amodern record isshown inFig.9:10
(a),and ofamodern reproducer in
Fig. 9:10(b).
Recordings arecutbyasteel needle
(stylus) inapolished slabofwax. This is
dusted with apowder such asgraphite
(anelectrical conductor) thenimmersed
inanelectrolytic bath ofbluestone, be-
coming copper plated onthepassage ofelectricity through thebath. The slab
emerges asanegative which isnow
reinforced byironand isused toimpress
duplicates oftheoriginal onplastic discs.
The electrical reproducer transforms
thevibrations oftheneedle asitfollows
thegroove into electric currents which
areamplified until they areable toacti-
vate aloudspeaker. Such reproducers
make asound more nearly likethe ori-
ginal than didtheformer mechanical
type.
Another form ofrecording ofgreat
use inmusic, inthe office and ina
host ofother locations isthe tape
recorder (Fig. 9:11). The principle first
usedwas totransform sounds into elec-
triccurrents andusethem, when ampli-
fied, tovary themagnetism inawire.
Later models used paper tape, coated
with athin layer ofmagnetic material.
Thishastheadvantage ofbeing compact
andcanbereadily edited. Inaddition,
anyrecorded matter maybeerased, per-
mitting thesame tape tobeusedmany
times.
Another type ofsound recording is

11:33 THEFUTURE OFSOUND
Noonecan foresee thefuture of
sound. The properties ofsounds inthe
audible range, that is,20-20,000 v.p.s.,
arewell understood. However, there is
much tobelearned about theultrasonic
vibrations whose frequencies arefrom
20,000 to500,000,000 v.p.s. Thedog
whistle (20,000 v.p.s.) and thesqueak
ofabat(30,000 v.p.s.) areatthelower
limit ofthisgroup ofvibrations.
Some present uses forultrasonic vibra-
tions follow. When used atanintensity
of160decibels ormore theyhave been
used toremove thedustand sootfrom
chimney gases. During World War II
Sonar (Sound, Navigation, andRang-
ing) was used atsea forsounding,
locating submarines orother ships, and
forunderwater communication. Peace-
time underwater uses include locating
schools offishandsunken ships. Another
use istocause molten metals tosetmore
quickly, thus giving them finer grain
structure and, thereby, greater strength.
Conversely, itisusedbylarge organiza-
tions todiscover flaws instructural
materials such asconcrete. Stillanother

The physiological effects ofthese
high-frequency sound waves areonly
beginning tobeunderstood. Research

deriving possible curative values. Truly,

CHAPTER 11 THENATURE AND
SOURCES OFHEAT
III :1HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Perhaps thegreatest single advance
made bymankind was thediscovery of
how tomake fire.The presence of
ashes andcharcoal incaves inhabited in
very ancient, times, shows that the dis-
covery may have taken place inthe
Stone Age orearlier. Man’s mastery of
firehasenabled him toprotect himself
from exposure tocold, tokill disease-
producing organisms and tofrighten off
wild beasts. Ithasallowed him tosmelt
copper and ironfrom which newwea-
pons and tools could befashioned.
Without thisdiscovery man might not
have risenfrom barbarism.
History reveals thevarious fire-pro-
ducing devices used.Onewastheignit-
ingofdrymoss orleaves byheatfrom
the friction between two dry sticks.
Another was theproduction ofsparks
when apiece ofpyrite (fools’ gold, a
sulphide ofiron) wasstruck aglancing
blow with asharp piece offlint (ahard,
compact mass ofsilica, themineral of
which sand iscomposed). Both ofthese
areafarcryfrom theuseofsuchmodern
devices asmatches, electrical igniters
etc.,although iheprinciple ofthe flint
igniter is stillemployed ingasandcigarette lighters. Themany develop-
ments intheproduction ofheat that
have occurred since early times give
ample evidence ofman’s creativeness.
Equally interesting aretheforward
strides made intheunderstanding of
thenature ofheatand thelaws that
govern itsuse.Notonlyhasman learned
how toproduce heat buthecannow
control it,retain it,measure it,transfer
itfrom place toplace and convert it
intomotive power. This study ofheat
issufficiently largeandimportant towar-
rantaspecial branch ofphysics, namely,
“thermodynamics”.
Ill :2THENATURE OFHEAT
(a)Caloric Theory
Until well into thenineteenth cen-
tury, most people believed inthe
Caloric Theory ofHeat inspite of
questionable proofs tosupport it.This
theory insisted that allempty spaces
inmatter contained afluid called caloric
and that thewarming orcooling ofa
body wasdue tothegain orlossinthe
amount ofthis fluid. The early Greeks
speculated thatheatwastherapid vibra-
torymotion ofthemolecules ofabody.
Francis Bacon (1561-1626) produced
some promising experimental evidence to
this effect.
In1798 anAmerican, Benjamin
Thompson, who later became Count
Rumford, made further investigations.
While directing theboring ofcannon,
hebecame interested intheamount of
109
Chap. 11 HEAT
heat produced intheprocess and de-
cided toinvestigate theproblem ofthe
nature ofheat. The adherents ofthe
caloric theory argued that caloric came
outwhen ironshavings wereformed and
that theshavings hadmore of itthan
theiron.Totest thistheory, heapplied
ablunt drill (toproduce fewshavings)
tothecannon with thewhole assembly
immersed inabox filled with water. In
ashort time theassembly became warm
and finally thewater boiled. Because
heat was produced aslong asthe
mechanism continued toturn,Rumford
concluded thatanything which could be
produced without limit, asheat had
been, could notbeamaterial substance
(caloric). Hereasoned that heatmust
becaused byavibratory motion inthe
material.
In1799 SirHumphrey Davy ofEng-
land dealt thecaloric theory thecoup
degrace byrubbing together twopieces
oficeinavacuum atatemperature
below themelting-point ofice.The
caloric theory held that asicecontained
nocaloric itcould notmeltunder these
conditions. Butmelt itdidand indoing
soafforded yetmore proof that heat
mustbeaproduct ofmotion.
(h)TheKinetic Theory ofMatter
According tothis theory, matter is
composed ofnumerous, tiny, moving
particles called molecules, each being
separated from itsneighbour byempty
space. Amolecule isdefined asthe
smallest particle ofasubstance which can
exist alone and possess theproperties of
that substance. Scientists areforced to
accept such atheory because theyknow
that gases, and toalesser extent liquids
and solids, diffuse, andthat gases donot
settle butmaintain auniform pressure
onthewalls ofthecontainer. Allthe
evidence indicates thatmolecules ofgases
areseparated bycomparatively vast dis-
tances, e.g.,water vapour molecules aremore than tentimes asfarapart as
water molecules, and possess great free-
dom ofmovement. Molecules ofliquids
havefreedom ofmovement butmust be
fairly close together, since liquids resist
compression. Insolids themolecules ex-
hibit great cohesion asillustrated by
their rigidity. Their closeness isshown
bytheir resistance ,tocompression. Their
movement issaid toconsist ofvibration
about certain positions inaprearranged
pattern.
(c)Heat— AForm ofEnergy
Energy isthe ability todowork.
Allmoving bodies candowork and
therefore have energy. Heat, which is
caused bythemotion ofthemolecules
ofabody, iscapable ofdoing workand
therefore must beaform ofenergy.
no
THENATURE ANDSOURCES OFHEAT Sec. 111:3
Thismay beillustrated with theaid
oftheapparatus shown inFig. 11:1.
When thetube isheated aneffect is
observed that imitates somewhat the
motion ofthemolecules. Themercury
vaporizes andthemolecules ofmercury
vapour drive the bits ofglass upward.
The pieces move about erratically, col-
liding withmercury molecules andeach
other. Heat iscausing themotion of
theparticles (molecules and glass) and
hence heatmust beaform ofenergy.
Under other circumstances heat energy
may betransformed intoother forms of
energy such aselectricity, light, etc.
Ill :3SOURCES OFHEAT
The origin ofheatmay beinferredfrom theLaw ofConservation ofEn-
ergy. This fundamental law ofnature
states thatenergy canneither becreated
nordestroyed although itmay betrans-
formed intoany ofitsmany forms. In
practice, ifamoving automobile is
brought toastopby itsbrakes, the
enei‘gy ofmotion which disappears
changes toheat energy inthebrakes.
From thisandnumerous other examples,
itisevident thatheat isproduced atthe
expense ofsome other form ofenergy.
Abrief discussion ofseveral sources of
heat (Fig. 11:2) willfollow.
(a)Mechanical Action
Inevery mechanical operation, the
output ofwork isalways somewhat less

than theinput ofenergy, the lossbeing
equal totheamount ofenergy con-
verted into heat. This isstated thus:
input=output -|-heat.
Allsuch operations involve friction,
because nosurface isperfectly smooth.
When onebody slides orrolls over
another, aswhen thehands arerubbed
together, some oftheenergy devoted
tothepurpose isconverted toheat.
Frequently, percussion, which isthe
sudden stopping ofamoving object
when itcollides with one atrest, e.g.,
hitting anail, isemployed inmechani-
cal operations. Here theenergy of
motion isconverted intomolecular mo-
tionwithin both bodies which ismani-
fested asheat.
Some operations involve compression
ofgases.Weknow from operating a
bicycle pump thatsome oftheenergy
applied changes into heat. IntheDiesel
engine (Sec. 111:31), theheatproduced
bycompression oftheairinthecylinder
issufficient toignite thefuel.
(h)Chemical Change
When afuel isburned inair,new
materials areformed and energy is
released. Such ahappening iscalled a
chemical change. Every substance has
itsshare ofstored chemical energy, a
form ofpotential energy, andwhen it
burns theproducts ofcombustion gen-
erally possess lessofitthandothe ori-
ginal materials. The difference inthe
two energies represents theamount
changed into heat. Forexample:
fuel+oxygen
carbon dioxide+water+heat.
The total energy ofthe fueland of
theoxygen equals the total energy of
thecarbon dioxide andofthewater plus
theenergy which was converted into
heat.(c)TheElectric Current
Whenever aconductor carries elec-
tricity, itbecomes warmer. This is
because electrical energy encounters re-
sistance toitsflow inmuch thesameway
aswater encounters resistance (friction)
while flowing through apipe. Just as
themoving water losesenergy asitover-
comes resistance, sotoodoesanelectric
current. The electrical energy lostbe-
comes transformed into heat. Heating-
elements clearly demonstrate this.
(d)TheAtom
Allmatter intheuniverse ismade up
from about onehundred different kinds
ofelements. Elements aresimple sub-
stances thathave notbeendecomposed
byordinary chemical means. They are
composed ofatoms which arethebuild-
ing-blocks forthemolecules ofallsub-
stances. Some atoms, like those of
uranium orradium, arevery large and
complex andchange intonew atoms
spontaneously. Asthey dosoasmall
amount ofmass changes into energy
some ofwhich becomes heat. There are
more details ofthisprocess inchap. 32.
Huge structures called atomic piles con-
trol this energy. Contrary topopular
belief, theenergy from thissource isnot
limitless but, nevertheless, amazingly
large. Forexample, ithasbeen estimated
thatonepound ofuranium canproduce
three million times asmuch energy as
onepound ofcoal orone pint ofoil.
Imagine how little uranium would be
required toheat yourhome forone
year!

111:6 APPLICATIONS OFEXPANSION
OFMETALS
Some applications ofexpansion have
been mentioned already and itisclear
that theexpansion ofmetals, though
small, must always betaken intoconsid-
eration. The errors inusing metal sur-
veying tapes havebeen largely overcome
bytheuseofinvar steel, anickel-steel
alloy containing 36percent ofnickel
andhaving acoefficient oflinear expan-
sionwhich isalmost negligible. Thesame
material isused forthependulums of
clocks toensure almost constant length
andaccurate time-keeping.
Watches arecontrolled byametal
balance-wheel (Fig. 12:3b) and hair-
spring, thetime ofoscillation ofthe
wheel being determined by itsdiameter.
Arise intemperature would cause the
diameter ofthewheel toincrease and.consequently, thewatch would losetime.
Tocompensate for thisdefect therim
ofthewheel ismade insegments, each
being abimetallic strip ofbrassand steel
with themore expansible metal onthe
outside. When thetemperature rises, the
segments curlinward, reducing the“ef-
fective diameter” ofthewheel and
compensating forthetroublesome in-
crease indiameter thatwould otherwise
occur.
The principle ofthebimetallic strip
finds other applications. One isthedial
thermometer (Fig. 12:4a). The essential
part ofthisinstrument isacoiled bi-
metallic strip, again with themore
expansible metal ontheoutside. One

Ill :7EXPANSION OFLIQUIDS
When liquids areheated, they too
Iexpand and,when cooled they contract
1(Fig. 12:7). The actual expansion or
contraction isalways somewhat greater
ithan that observed because oftheex-
pansion andcontraction ofthecontainer.
With suitable apparatus, theexpansion
involume percentigrade degree, i.e.,the
coefficient ofexpansion involume, may
'bedetermined. Some liquids, like al-
T;cohol, show alarger coefficient thanothers. Most, except mercury, show a
different coefficient atdifferent tem-
peratures. The tableshows afewofthese
coefficients including some coefficients of
expansion forwater atvarious tempera-
tures. It isthisproperty ofaliquid
which often determines itssuitability for
certain purposes, such asinther-
mometers. Again allowance must be

therefore, somemeans ofmeasuring tem-
perature that ismore sensitive andmore
reliable than that provided byhuman
sensations isneeded for scientific pur-
poses. Wemust have aprecise, con-
sistent scale oftemperature and an
instrument formeasuring itaccurately.
The evolution ofthemodern ther-
mometer isaninteresting story. Students
areadvised toconsult agood encyclo-
pedia forthecontributions ofsuchmen
asGalileo, Viviani, Rey, Boulliau and
others whohave shared initsperfection.Themodern thermometer iscon-
structed from alength ofcapillary tubing
ofuniform bore, sealed atoneendby
heating itinaflame. Bygently blowing
down thetubewhen itishot,asmall
bulb isproduced atB(Fig. 12:8). This
should bevery thin iftheinstrument ‘is
toregister rapidly. After thetube has
cooled, asmall funnel isattached tothe
open endA,andclean drymercury is
poured into it.Before themercury will
fillthebore itisnecessary toheatand
cool thebulb alternately toforce the
airpast themetal. When thetube is
full, itisheated toexpel anyremaining
traces ofair.Thebulb isnowplaced in
abath ofliquid which hasatempera-
ture of10° to15°higher than the
highest temperature which the ther-
mometer will berequired toregister.
Using thefineblow-pipe flame, thetube
issealed atapoint justbelow thefree
surface ofthemercury. Onremoving
thethermometer from the bath, the
mercury contracts inthestem, leaving a
vacuum inthespace above it.
Tograduate thethermometer, we
choose twofixed temperatures which can
beeasily obtained, andmark the level
ofthemercury onthestemwhen each
ofthese temperatures hasbeen main-
tained forsome little time. The tem-
peratures chosen arethefreezing- and

cury). Theformer iscalled thelower

The comparison ofthese two scales

atemperature onone scale toacor-
responding temperature onthe other.
However, before weattempt any con-versions itshould bestressed that °C.
and °F. refer toactual temperatures
whereas C.°and F.°refer -toachange

For example, the difference between
15°G. and15C.° isshown inFig.12:11.
(d)Conversion ofTemperatures
Since both temperature scales are
legal, itisimportant thatwebeable to
convert acentigrade reading into the
corresponding Fahrenheit reading, and
vice versa. The following examples will
showhow this isdone.

they have mastered theprevious solu-
tions.
Ill ;9EXPANSION OFGASES
You willremember from your earlier
studies ofscience that gases expand on
heating and contract oncooling (Fig.
12:12). Inaddition, youwill recall that
gases expand much more than liquids
122
EXPANSION CAUSED BYHEAT Sec. Ill:9
and solids foragiven change oftem-
perature, i.e.,they have agreater co-
efficient ofexpansion. Itmay seem
Fig.12:12 Expansion ondContraction
ofGases.
strange, but isnevertheless true, that all
gases have almost exactly thesame
coefficient ofexpansion. Thismay be
expressed thus:
“Atconstant pressure, thevolume ofa
given mass ofgasIncreases by1/273 of
itsvolume at0°C. foreach centigrade
degree riseintemperature”.
Itshould benoted that, because gases
arecompressible, constant pressure must
beprescribed for this relationship to
hold.
Aspecial useofthecoefficient ofex-
pansion ofgases isindetermining “ab-
solute zero”. Ifwewere provided with
atube containing 273 c.c.ofgasat0°C.
itwould contain 263 c.c.at—10°C., 200c.c.at—73°C., and theoretically, 0c.c.
at—273°C.Weknow, ofcourse, thatwe
cannot destroy matter inthiswayand
that thegaswould have changed in
state before reaching thistemperature.
This temperature, —273°C., iscalled
absolute zero, atemperature atwhich
bodies possess noheat whatever, all
molecular motion having ceased. More
accurately, absolute zero is—273.16°C.
The lowest temperature sofarrecorded
is.005° above absolute zero.
Absolute zero isthelowest point on
another temperature scale, theAbsolute
orKelvin Temperature Scale, firstpro-
posed byLord Kelvin, agreat English
scientist (1824-1907). This finds appli-
cation inthecalculation ofthevolumes
ofgases and willbeused extensively for
thatpurpose inyour chemistry course.

CHAPTER 13 TRANSFER OFHEAT
III;12HOWHEAT ISDISTRIBUTED
Inaprevious chapter westudied the
sources ofheat energy. Hereweshall
learnhow heat isconveyed from the
source sothat itmay bemade togo
where itisrequired, orprevented from
going where itisnotneeded. When a
saucepan touches ahotstove itbecomes
warm: heathastravelled byconduction.
The current ofwarm airabove ahot
radiator iscarried upwards byconvec-
tion.Afire-place sends outheat by
radiation. Thus, thethree methods of
heat transfer are; conduction, convec-
tionandradiation.
Ill :13CONDUCTION
(a)Solids
Ifoneend ofanironbar isplaced
inafire,theother end willsoonbecome
warm. Theheatenergy hasbeen trans-
ferred along thebarbytheprocess of
conduction. The rate ofvibration ofthe
molecules atthehotend,and therefore
their energy, hasbeen greatly increased,
and this results inthemolecules insuc-
cessive sections ofthebar acquiring
increased energy bythechain ofcolli-
sions that results. Inthismanner heatistransmitted from molecule tomolecule
along thelength ofthebaruntil thefar
endbecomes hot.
Metals aregenerally good conductors
ofheat, some better than others. The
differences intheconductivities offour
different metals may beshown byper-
forming experiment 3,chapter 15,using
aconductometer similar tothatshown

andnot asconductive astheothers, is
used forboilers because itcanwithstand
theforces ofhigh pressure better than
theother metals.
Certain other solid substances, such
aschina, plastic material, wood, bone,
etc., areemployed fortheir lowconduc-
tivity, i.e., their inability topass heat
from molecule tomolecule readily. These
substances areknown asinsulators. Fur-
therexamples arecorkused inthewalls
ofrefrigerators, rock wool, used inouter
walls ofhomes and thewrapping of
water tanks, wool forclothing andbed-
ding, glassandporcelain food containers,
sawdust inice-houses, andmany others.
Some ofthese, because ofthelooseness
oftheir texture, contain airpockets
which contribute immeasurably totheir
insulating properties, airbeing amost
efficient insulator.
(h)Liquids
When atest-tube full ofwater or
other liquid isheld atthebottom while
thetop isheated byaBunsen burner

liquids arepoor conductors ofheat. If
thepositions ofthehand andburnerare reversed, heat will betransferred
quickly from bottom totop, butby
convection currents (Sec. 111:14), not
byconduction. Toavoid confusion, it
should bestressed that theruleabout
thepoor conductivity ofliquids does
not include mercury, which, being a
metal, isagood conductor.
(c)Gases
Ifthehand isheld close toaBunsen-
burner flame, theresulting burn isnotas
intense aswhen gripping ametal barat
thesame distance from theflame. This
demonstrates that air(oranygas) isa
poorconductor ofheat.When werecall
that gases arecomposed ofmolecules
that arevery farapart and that heat
conductivity depends ontheactual con-
tactbetween molecules, weunderstand
why gases arepoor conductors ofheat.
Theabove factconcerning gases has
many practical applications. Inpart (a)
ofthis section, reference wasmade to
certain solid insulating materials with
loose texture. Many ofthese, such as
fur,wool, sawdust, rock wool, asbestos,
snow, etc.,depend onthepoor conduc-
tivity ofpockets ofairtrapped inthem
foralarge part oftheir insulating
properties. Storm-windows, thermopane
andthehollow construction oftheouter
walls ofbuildings (Fig. 13:2) likewise
have insulating value because ofthe
poor heat conductivity oftheenclosed
air.

temperatures ofitsvarious partsandthe
resulting difference indensities iscalled
aconvection current. Allgases show
thisphenomenon. The apparatus used
toillustrate convection currents ingases

III :15RADIATION
(a)Introduction
When youstand before acamp-fire,
youareaware ofitsintense heat. Since
theeffectmay beprevented byholding
upablanket between yourself and the
fire,you willconclude that theenergy
travels instraight lines. Since thesame
thing happens on allsides ofthe fire,
thisenergy must radiate inalldirec-
tions, i.e., travel along the radii ofa
sphere with the fireatthecentre. This
kind ofenergy isaform ofradiant
energy and themethod oftransfer is
called radiation. Itisonlywhen this
energy strikes anobject and isabsorbed
that itchanges toheat energy. Transfer
ofenergy byradiation isdifferent from
conduction andconvection since the lat-
terrequire amaterial medium, whereas
radiation may proceed through ava-
cuum. Forexample, radiant energy from
thesun traverses 93X10®miles of
space, most ofwhich isempty. Oragain,
energy may radiate from thefilament to
theglass envelope ofanevacuated radio
tube.
Radiant energy isawave-motion and
hasmany properties incommon withlight. Themajor heat effect comes from
theinfra-red radiations justbeyond the
redofthevisible spectrum (Sec.IV:38).
Subsequent references toradiant energy
inthissection refer tothese infra-red ra-
diations. Allbodies whose temperatures
areabove absolute zero (Sec. III:9)
emit thiskind ofenergy attheexpense of
theenergy ofmotion oftheir atoms or
molecules. The rate ofemission andthe
wave-length ofthe radiation ispro-
portional tothetemperature: thehigher
thetemperature, thefaster therateand
theshorter thewave-length. Thewaves
arebelieved tobeofthe transverse
variety which, according toonetheory,
are setupbyaminute pulse ofenergy,

(h)TheEmission ofRadiant Energy
Intheintroduction tothis section, it
was stated that radiant energy isre-
leased attheexpense ofmotion ofthe
molecules. Itmay wellbeasked whether
ornot allobjects under thesame con-
ditions emit thisform ofenergy. To
find theanswer, experiment 5,chapter
15,should beperformed.
Forthepurposes ofdiscussion, letus

thermometer ineachandsupport them
onidentical insulating-bases. Although
both are atthesame temperature ini-
tially, thewater inthedark, dullcan
cools more quickly than that inthe
light, shiny one.Nomatter howwe
perform suchanexperiment wealways
find that dark, dull surfaces aregood
emitters ofradiant energy, while light,
shiny ones arepoor inthisrespect. Itis
admitted that other factors, such as
starting temperature andarea ofsurface
also affect theratebutforthepurpose of
ourdiscussion, these were kept constant.(c)TheAbsorption ofRadiant
Energy
Aswas suggested previously, heat
results when radiant energy isabsorbed.
Acritical thinker willwant toknow if
different objects absorb this energy
equally well.Toanswer this inpart,
experiment 6,chapter 15,should be
performed. Another demonstration (Fig.
13:10) involves twothermometers, one
darkened and dulled bythesootfrom
acandle flame, theother left lightand
shiny, placed atequal distances oneither

thedark, dullsurface risesmore quickly
than thatwith the light, shiny surface.

light without reflecting much ofitand

light without absorbing much of it.In

faces arepoor absorbers andgood re-
flectors. Knowing thiswewear light-
coloured clothes insummer anddark
ones inwinter.
(d)TheTransmission ofRadiant
Energy
Certain materials are“transparent”
or“opaque” toward radiant energy just
assome aretoward light. Asanexam-
ple, icedoes nottransmit much radiant
energy, while rock salttransmits almost
allthat fallsupon it.Glass, ontheother
hand, transmits well theshorter wave-
lengths that originate from ahigh-tem-
perature source like thesunbutdoes
nottransmit thelonger ones that ori-
ginate from alow-temperature source
such astheearth oraliving object. This
property ofglass makes ituseful in
greenhouses (part (f)below).
(e)Some Detectors ofRadiant
Energy
The simplest device isthedarkened
air-thermometer, orthermoscope, where
radiant energy isconverted intomolecu-
larmotion which manifests itself asa
riseoftemperature (Fig. 13:11a).
The radiometer (Fig. 13:11b) con-
sists ofanalmost completely evacuated
glass bulb inwhich four lightaluminum
vanes aremounted soastoturn easily.
One sideofeachvane isblackened while
theother isleft shiny. When radiant
energy fallsupon thevanes, theblack
surfaces become warmer than theothers.
Accordingly thefew airmolecules adja-
cent totheblack sides willbecome heated
and willmove away from thevanes.
The reaction ofthevanes causes them
toturn about their pivot. Themore
radiant energy that enters, the faster
will thevanes turn. This instrument is
very sensitive tosmall amounts ofradiant
energy.Fig. 13:11 Some Detectors ofRa-
diant Energy, (a)Thermoscope.

(f)Applications ofRadiant Energy
Thevacuum orthermos bottle (Fig.
13:12) isadouble- walled glass bottle,
with ahighvacuum between thewalls,
contained inasuitable protective carry-
ing case. The inner glass walls facing
each other aresilvered. Liquids, whether
hotorcold, willremain atvery nearly
thesame temperature forseveral hours.
The reason isthat thebottle issocon-
structed that itisvery difficult forheat
tobetransferred byany ofthethree
methods described above.Weshall con-
sider thestoring ofahot liquid here.
Similar explanations obtain foracold

1.Thevacuum prevents the loss of
heat byconduction owing tothe
lack ofmolecules present. The trans-
ferofheat through the glass and
thestopper isslow owing tothe
poor conducting property ofeach.
2.Convection from inside the bottle

Lossbyconvection intheairspace
between the glass and thecase is
prevented bybeing closed atthetop.
3.Heat lossbyradiation isprevented
bythesilvered surfaces ofthewalls.
These reflect back intothebottle any
radiant energy that tends toescape.
Greenhouses and cold frames (Fig.
13:13) areheated byradiation. The
short wave-length radiant-heat energy
from thesun isreadily transmitted by
theglass. This isabsorbed bytheplants,
soil, etc.within; astheir temperatures
rise, they loseheatbyradiation. Since

Atnight theclouds provide ablanket

fuelsandfoods areused widely because
oftheir large energy content.
Hi:18THECOMPARISON OF
QUANTITY OFHEATAND
TEMPERATURE
When twoequal masses ofwater are
heated bythesame source forthesame
length oftime, each willshow thesame
rise intemperature. Iftheexperiment
isrepeated with onemass larger than
theother (Fig. 14:1), thesmaller mass
willshow agreater rise intemperature.
Iftwounequal masses ofwater are
heated tothesame temperature bythe
same source, thelarger mass willrequire
tobeheated foralonger time. Itis
evident thattemperature and quantity
ofheat areentirely different andshould
never beconfused.
Ill :19FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE
THEQUANTITY OFHEAT
Weare allfamiliar with thefactthat
abasin ofhotwatermay becooled by
theaddition ofcoldwater and that the
final temperature ofthemixture willbe
lower than that ofthehotwater and
higher than that ofthecold.Werealize
that thehotwater becomes cool as ft
gives heat tothecoldwater while the
cold water becomes warm because it
gains heat from the hot. This isthe
principle ofheatexchange and itapplies
whenever substances atdifferent tem-
peratures aremixed (Sec. 111:22).
137
Chap. 14 HEAT
Letusmixtwoequal masses ofwater,
atdifferent temperatures, each with
equal masses ofwater, atthesame
temperature. Since thewarmer water
gives risetothehigher finaltemperature
(seeexample), themass atthehigher
temperature obviously contains thegreat-
erquantity ofheat. Therefore, the
quantity ofheat contained inabody
varies asitstemperature. Forexample:
When 100gm. ofwater at80°C.are
added to100gm.ofwater at20°C., the
final temperature is50°C.
When 100gm. ofwater at40°C. are
added to100gm.ofwater at20°C., the
finaltemperature is30°C.
Let usmixtwo different masses of
water, atthesame temperature, each
with equal masses ofwater, atthesame
temperature. Asthelarger mass gives
risetothehigher finaltemperature (see
example), itfollows that thelarger mass
contains the larger quantity ofheat.
Thus, thequantity ofheatcontained in
abody varies asitsmass. Forexample:
When 100gm. ofwater at80°C.are
added to100gm. ofwater at20°C.,
the final temperature is50°C.
When 200gm. ofwater at80°C. are
added to100gm.ofwater at20°C., the
finaltemperature is60°C.
Sofar,wehave dealt with quantitiesofwater intheabove examples, but
what would betheeffect ofusing one
different substance along with water?
For example, letusmixtwo equal
masses, one ofwater andone ofiron
filings, atthesame temperature, withtwo
equal masses ofwater, also atthesame
temperature. Thewater will give rise
tothehigher final temperature (see ex-
ample), because itcontains more heat
than the iron. Hence, thequantity of
heat contained inabody depends upon
thenature ofthematerial ofwhich itis
composed. Forexample:
When 100gm. ofwater at80°C. are
added to100gm.ofwater at20°C., the
finaltemperature is50°C.
When 100gm. ofiron filings at80°C.
areadded to100gm.ofwater at20°C.,
thefinaltemperature is26°C.
Ill :20THEUNITS FORMEASURING
THEQUANTITY OFHEAT
Because water isacommon substance
and itscapacity forheat issogreat, it

111:22 THEPRINCIPLE OFHEAT
EXCHANGE INMIXTURES
Aswas explained inSec. 111:19,
whenever two substances atdifferent
temperatures aremixed orincontact,
heat passes from thewarm one tothe
coolone until both have attained thesame temperature. Because heat isa
form ofenergy andenergy canneither
becreated nordestroyed (Sec.HI:3),it
follows that thequantity ofheat lostby
thewarm body equals thequantity of
heatgained bythecoolone. This isthe
principle ofheatexchange.

Themethod generally employed is

amaterial which absorbs itsheat, say
water. From thevarious observations
within thecalorimeter thespecific heat
ofthemetal canbecalculated. Abrief
summary ofthemethod andamodel
solution follow. Full details ofthemethod are tobefound inexperiment

Ill :25APPLICATIONS OFSPECIFIC
HEAT
Specific heats affect our livesmore
thanwerealize. Water hasthehighest
specific heat ofallcommon substances
(Sec. 111:21). Substances with alow
specific heat undergo agreat rise in
temperature when agiven quantity of
heat isabsorbed. When cooled, thosesame substances undergo alarge drop in
temperature. Ontheother hand, water
gains orloses agreat quantity ofheat
without much change intemperature.
Thehigh specific heat ofwater makes
ituseful inthecooling system ofan
automobile engine and inhot-water

radiator tobedissipated. Because ithas
ahigher specific heat than land, water
does notreach ashigh atemperature
during thesummer season orduring the
day. Inthewinter season, oratnight,
water willnotcool toaslowatempera-
ture asland forthesame reason. Thus
temperatures overwater ornear itwill
always bemore moderate than inland.
Forexample theNiagara region has
amore moderate climate because of
thewater round it.The Prairie Pro-
vinces, ontheother hand, will experi-
enceextremes oftemperature since there
arenomoderating influences. The daily
differences intemperature referred to
above arealsoresponsible forland- and
sea-breezes (Sec. 111:14) incoastal re-
gions. Agriculturalists know well that
wet soils donotwarm asrapidly in
spring asdry, because ofthis high
specific heat ofwater. Dry, sandy soils
warm upmore quickly, produce crops
earlier and frequently yieldmore than
onecrop inaseason.
Metals, asarule, have low specific
heats (Sec. 111:21), and thismakes
them ideal forcooking utensils.Ill :26HEATEXCHANGE DURING
CHANGES OFSTATE
Allmatter isfound ineither the
solid, liquid orgaseous state. These are
the three physical states ofmatter.
Each state ofmatter consists ofmoving
molecules separated from each other by
spaces thatvary with the state, largest
ingases, intermediate inliquids and
smallest insolids. The rate ofmotion of
themolecules isfaster, andtheamount
ofspace between them larger, athigher
temperatures. Each statemay becon-
verted intoone oftheothers bythe
addition orremoval ofheat. Insolids
and liquids, there isaforce ofattraction
between themolecules known asthe
force ofcohesion which must beover-
come bytheabsorption ofheat energy
before aliquid orgasstatemay result.
Fig.14:4 shows these changes instate
diagrammatically.

thequantity ofheat, melting and freez-
ingareboth occurring atthesame rate,
i.e.,equilibrium will exist between the
iceandthewater. Itisonlywhen heat

To illustrate heat exchange during
boiling, letusheat aquantity ofwater
from 0°G. to100°C., stirring constantly
with athermometer. Itisfound that the

although heat isbeing absorbed con-

toraise thetemperature. Thetempera-
ture atwhich thewater ischanging
from liquid tovapour throughout the
whole mass iscalled theboiling-point.
Boiling and evaporation are distin-
guished bythefact thatvapour forms
throughout thebody ofthe liquid in
theformer while occurring only atthe
surface inthe latter. Because boiling-
points vary with theatmospheric pres-
sure (Fig. 14:5), they areexpressed
with relation tostandard atmospheric
pressure (760mm. ofmercury). It
should berecognized that theboiling-
point isthesame asthetemperature
atwhich condensation occurs, and the
quantity ofheat released when aunit
mass ofvapour condenses isthesame as
thatabsorbed during vaporization. More-
over, ifthetemperature ofamass of
liquid iskept attheboiling-point with
nochange inthequantity ofheat,
vaporization andcondensation take place
simultaneously atthesame rate, i.e.,
equilibrium exists between liquid and
vapour. It isonlywhen achange in
thequantity ofheat occurs that either
process predominates.Ill :27DETERMINING THEHEAT OF

Small pieces oficethathave been

When theice iscompletely melted, the

III :28THEIMPORTANCE OFTHE
HEATOFFUSION OFICE
When onegram oficemelts without
achange intemperature, 80calories of
heat areabsorbed. This isenough heat
toraise thetemperature ofonegram of
water at20°C. totheboiling-point, or
of80grams ofwater through onecenti-
grade degree. Since such alarge quan-
tity ofheat isrequired tomelt ice, it
isnot difficult tounderstand why ice
isuseful inpreserving food.
There areimportant consequences of
thislarge heat offusion innature. Ice-
bergs float long distances before absorb-
ingenough heat tomelt. Large snow-
fallsmelt slowly anddisastrous floods are
avoided. Since iceonlakesandstreams
melts slowly inspring, sudden extreme
changes intemperature donotoccur.
Ontheother hand, theheat released
when water freezes isuseful. Tubs of
water are setnear fruits andvegetables
inunheated basements when there isa
chance offrost damage. Asthetem-
perature drops, thewater freezes and
theheat released prevents thefruits from
freezing.
The heat released when lakes and
rivers freeze hasamoderating effect and
prevents extremes oftemperature. This
helps tomake theclimate ofregions
likeSouthern Ontario milder than re-
gionsmore distant from large bodies of
water. Furthermore, theweather gen-
erally becomes milder before orduring
asnowstorm because oftheheat released
when thewater vapour changes tosolid.These examples andmany moremaybe

Inboiling water, thequantity ofheat
required toconvert aunitmass ofwater

change intemperature iscalled the

metric system, theheat ofvaporization
isthequantity ofheatrequired tochange
onegram ofwater at100°C. tosteam
at100°G. (atmospheric pressure being
760mm. ofmercury). Experiment 9,
chapter 15,describes themethod used to
determine it.Abriefsummary ofthe
method, some typical results andaset
ofcalculations follow.
The quantity ofheat required to
vaporize aunitmass ofwater at its
boiling-point isthesame asthat released
when aunitmass ofsteam condenses.
Since the latter ismore easily deter-
mined, themethod involves using it
rather than theformer. Hence, steam
from aboiler ispassed through asteam
trap tofree itofwater (It isnow called
“dry” or“live” steam). Itisthen con-
ducted intoaquantity ofcoolwater of
known massandtemperature contained
intheweighed inner vessel ofacalori-
meter ofknown specific heat (Fig.

and, shortly, thefinaltemperature isre-
corded. The vessel and contents are

VAPORIZATION
(a)Water
The high heat ofvaporization of
water isofgreat practical importance in
nature. Evaporation ofsoilwater isslow
because ofthevastquantity ofheat re-
quired forthispurpose. Thus extremes
ofdrought and torrential rains that
would attend excessive evaporation are
avoided.
Steam-heating, asused inmost large
public buildings, isanexcellent ex-Fig. 14:6 Determining theHeat of

ample ofheat ofvaporization atwork.
Water isboiled; thesteam isconducted
toradiators where itcondenses andyields
itsheat ofvaporization. Thehotwater
now flows back totheboiler tobeused
again. This system ischeaper than hot-
water heating (Sec. 111:14) assmaller
radiators arerequired and thesteam
pipe itself often serves asawater return.
Cooling isfrequently accomplished by
evaporation. The faster-moving mole-
cules oftheliquid escape firstandthe
temperature falls. Further evaporation

occurs only ifmore heat isabsorbed
from itssurroundings. This istheprin-
ciple involved intheuseofperspiration
toregulate body temperature, thesprink-
ling ofcity streets with water onhot
summer evenings, and thealcohol rub
toreduce fever.
(b)Refrigerators
The refrigerator makes use ofthe

isagaswhich canbeliquefied without
difficulty andwhich hasahigh heat of

ammonia, sulphur dioxide, methyl chlor-
ide,and—themost widely used—-freon
12(dichlorodifluorom ethane ).
The parts ofarefrigerator areshown
inFig. 14:8. In it,asmall electric
motor operates acompressor which
forces thegasinto the coils ofacon-
denser. Here itcondenses because of
thepressure andcooling (SeeFaraday’s
experiment below) .Asmall fan isoften
provided forcooling purposes, though
loss ofheatbyradiation isfrequently
sufficient. The liquid proceeds tothe

same principle.The gasrefrigerator (Fig. 14:9) in-
volves nomoving parts and is,conse-
quently, silent and automatic. The
sealed tubes contain water, ammonia and
hydrogen. Ammonia, which isordinarily
very soluble, isexpelled from thewater
bytheheat oftheflame.Acombination
ofthepressure created and thesimul-
taneous cooling bythe aircauses am-
monia toliquefy. Itnow proceeds to
the cooling-unit, evaporates, absorbs
heat, redissolves inthewater and is
ready torepeat theprocess. Hydrogen
isused toprevent theformation ofa
vacuum which otherwise would becaused

This avoids “pounding”. The refrigera-
tor issimple initsprinciple ofoperation
but itsstructure issomewhat more com-
plicated than this explanation would
leadone tobelieve.
(c)TheLiquefaction ofGases
Michael Faraday, aboutwhom we
shall learn more later (Sec. V:57),
devised aningenious method oflique-
fying gases.Hefilled athick-walled glass

iceand salt. Heating thegas inthe
other endcaused ariseinpressure while
thegasliquefied inthecoolend. Inthis
wayhewas also able toliquefy several
other gases. This principle isemployed
inthegasrefrigerator above.
Faraday found that certain gases, for
example, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
airandmany others, could notbelique-
fied inthisway. Itwasfound that these
gases had tobecooled toacertain
temperature, called thecritical tempera-
ture, before anyamount ofpressure
would liquefy them. The pressure re-
quired toliquefy thegas atthistem-
perature isknown asthe critical pres-
sure.
Itshould benoted thatwhen the
operating temperature islower than the
critical temperature, the pressure re-
quired forliquefaction isverymuch
lower than the critical pressure. It is
not difficult tounderstand, then,why

agas oflow critical temperature, the
gas issubjected tothecooling effect of
anexpanding cold gasaround it,inor-
der toreach thelowtemperature re-
quired. This principle isseen inopera-
tion inthe liquefaction ofair (Fig,
14:11).
The air isfirstcompressed andthen
circulated through cooling-coils tore-
move theheat ofcompression. Itpasses
onthrough the needle-valve ofthe
liquefier where itexpands, cools, and
returns tothecompressor byway ofa
pipewhich surrounds theonethat car-

processes arerepeated continuously, the
gas issoon cooled toitscritical tem-
perature andhence itliquefies.

111:31 THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
HEATANDWORK
Ancient civilization accomplished work,
such asbuilding thePyramids, byutiliz-
ingslave-labour. Inrecent times various
machines have been developed which
convert heat into work, soreleasing
manfrommuch drudgery.
Man hasknown since thetime of
Rumford andDavy (Sec. Ill:2)that
work could beconverted into heat.
Later itwasshown that heat canbe
made todowork. When apound of
coal burns, forexample, enough heat
(14,500 B.T.U.) isgenerated toraise
atonofmaterial through 5,000 feet.
Inpractice, only afraction oftheen-
ergyfrom fuel isavailable todouseful

through radiation, conduction, convec-
tion, friction etc.The small fraction
actually available compared tothetotal
possible amount ofenergy iscalled the
efficiency. The examples that follow
show theefficiency ofvarious kinds of
engines.

TheSteam-Engine
Inthecommon steam- or“recipro-
cating”-engine, thepressure exerted by
livesteam (dryandmuch hotter than
100°C.) pushes thepiston back and
forth inthe cylinder. The back-and-
forth motion ismade possible byan
automatic slide-valve which firstadmits
thesteam atoneend ofthecylinder,
thus driving thepiston totheopposite
end,andthen admits thesteam atthis
end, thus forcing thepiston back toits
original position (Fig. 14:12). This
motion rotates thefly-wheel which, being
heavy, enables theengine tooperate
smoothly.
TheSteam Turbine
This type ofsteam-engine iswidely
used inpower-plants and large ships.Itconsists ofaspecially designed paddle-
wheel against which steam athigh pres-
sure isdirected through nozzles (Fig.

pressed toabout one-sixteenth of its
volume andforthatreason becomes hot.
When oil isforced into thishot gas,
itburns, without anyneed foraspark.
TheJetEngine
The lastfewyears have seen thevery
rapid development ofanewtype ofin-
ternal combustion engine, theJetEngine.
There areseveral types ofsuch engines;
thecommonest, however, istheTurbo-
Jet.Air isscooped intotheintake atthe
front oftheengine. Itiscompressed, and
consequently heated, byacompressor.
Thisheated air isdriven under high pres-
sure into thecombustion chamber where
fuel isinjected inandcombustion occurs.
The hotexpanding gases stream awayatahigh velocity. Asmall portion of
their energy isused todrive theturbine
which operates thecompressor. Most
oftheenergy isinthestream ofhot
gases which isejected from therear of
theengine. The force exerted bythisjet
ofhotgases (action) creates anequal
andopposite force (reaction) that drives
theplane forward.
Rockets areanother type ofmodern
reaction engine that operate very simi-
larly tothejetengine described above.
They differ inthatthey carry theirown
supply ofoxygen toburn the fuel. As
aresult rockets cantravel through outer

CHAPTER 16 NATURE ANDPROPAGATION
OFLIGHT
IV :1NATURE OFLIGHT
Light isthatagency which affects the
eyeandproduces thesensation of“see-
ing” (sight). That branch ofphysics
that covers allthephenomena pertain-
ing tolight iscalled Optics (Greek,
ops—eye). Some knowledge oflight
existed from very early times, though
thiswas limited primarily toeffects
rather than toanyfundamental under-
standing.
Astothenature oflight, theearly
Greeks believed ittoconsist ofstreams
ofminute particles ofsome sort. There
was considerable debate astowhether
these particles originated intheeyeor
intheobject viewed. Plato (428-348
B.G.) andEuclid (about 300 b.c.) held
totheidea that invisible feelers were
emitted from theeye,and that theeye
seesabodysomewhat asthehandmay
feel itwith arod.The Pythagoreans,
Aristotle (284-322 b.c.) inparticular, op-
posed thisview and taught that light
consisted ofminute particles projected
intotheeyefrom theobject. Both these
conflicting ideas weremere guesses and
assuchwere worthless. However, inthe
eleventh century Alhazen, anArabian
physicist, provided definite evidenceshowing that thecause ofvision pro-
ceeded from theobject andnottheeye.
Even to-day, much mystery still sur-
rounds thenature oflight (Sec.IV; 7).
Inview ofthe fact that light canbe
produced from other forms ofenergy,
e.g.,heat energy, and that light canbe
transformed intoother forms ofenergy,
e.g., electricity (Sec. V:82), weshall
simply saythat light isaform ofenergy.
IV:2SOURCES OFLIGHT
Few objects give out lightand these
aretermed luminous bodies. Most ob-
jects arenon-luminous, becoming visible
onlywhen they reflect lightfromsome
outside source tooureyes (Fig. 16:1).
Ourmain source oflight isthesun.
When wethinkhowimportant thesun
hasalways been inhuman affairs, itis
notsurprising that inprehistoric times
itbecame aprime object ofworship.
History records theancient Egyptian
Sun-god, Ra,andanancient Persian god
oflight, Ahura-mazda. Theterms “ray”
oflight, and“mazda” lamps arede-
rived from these names.
Many objects arerendered luminous
bybeing heated toincandescence. This
may beaccomplished bymechanical
means asshown when sparks arepro-
duced byfriction between flintand steel
inagas-lighter; byresistance toan
electric current inthethinwire used in
electric-light bulbs; andbychemical ac-
tion asintheburning ofafuel.Some
objects areluminous atordinary tem-

inous Objects.
peratures, astick ofphosphorus, for
example, and fluorescent bodies. Then
there istheglow produced bythe dis-
charge ofelectricity through certain
gases, e.g.,neon tubes. Another interest-
ingexample of“cold light” isthat pro-
duced byfireflies, andbycertain deep-
sea fish. Probably such light isproduced
bychemical means.
IV:3TRANSMISSION OFLIGHT
Unlike sound, light does notrequire
amaterial medium for itstransmission.
Evidence insupport ofthis issupplied by
the fact that light travels through a
vacuum incoming tousfrom objects in
space, andfrom theglowing filament
ofanevacuated tube. Further evidence
wasprovided inexperiment 4,chapter
10,where wecould nothear the bell
when theairwasevacuated from thejar
yetcould stillsee itringing.
Various media diflfer intheir ability
totransmit light. Transparent objects
such asair, glass andwater transmit
light soreadily that itiseasy tosee
through them.Atranslucent substance.such asfrosted glass oroiled paper, is
one that transmits some light, but in
doing sodistorts orscatters the light
sothatwecannot seeclearly objects
ontheother side.Opaque substances,
likewood, donottransmit light atall
andhence wecannot seethrough them.
Itiscommon knowledge that light
travels instraight lines.Our inability to
seearound corners, theformation of
shadows, and other examples point to
thisconclusion. This behaviour oflight
istermed rectilinear propagation. Know-
ing this,werepresent apath oflight
byastraight line called aray. (Note:
the light that travels along thispath
isalso called aray.) The direction in
which thelight istravelling isindicated
byarrow-heads placed ontherays. Sev-
eral parallel raysform abeam oflight.
Rays oflightproceeding towards apoint
form aconverging pencil; when they
spread outfrom apoint theyform a
diverging pencil (Fig. 16:2).
IV:4PIN-HOLE CAMERA

This kind ofimage isformed asa
result ofverynarrow diverging pencils
oflight from each point oftheobject
passing through thepin-hole, and pro-
ducing small patches oflight, identical

The resulting image isformed byalarge

light, producing anexact replica ofthe

lapping. The larger thepin-hole the

Theimage isinverted because thelight

IV :5SHADOWS AND ECLIPSES
Ashadow isthedark space behind an
opaque object, anarea from which
light hasbeen partially orcompletely
excluded. Anopaque object infront of
apoint source oflight willcutoff all
the light, andasharply defined shadow
isproduced. Ifthe lightcomes from a
larger source, theshadow willvary in
intensity, thedark central portion ofthe
shadow which receives nolightfromany
part ofthesource being theumbra
(Fig. 16:4a), the lighter shadow sur-
rounding theumbra which receives some
light being thepenumbra (Fig. 16:4b).
Aneclipse ofthesun isaninteresting
shadow phenomenon caused when the
moon comes between thesunandearth

moon’s umbra will observe atotal

that themoon comes between thesun
andtheearth atatimewhen itsumbra

Aperson located ontheearth below the
tipofthemoon’s umbra would seearing

Such aneclipse iscalled anannular
eclipse ofthesunand occurs very
rarely.
Eclipses ofthemoon also occur, and
atfairly frequent intervals. Themoon
isanon-luminous body, and isseenonly
when sunlight isreflected from itssur-
face totheearth. The fullmoon occurs
when themoon isontheopposite side
oftheearth from thesun.Atsuchatime

from EgtoE^,Fig. 16:6). Romer as-
cribed thediscrepancy tothetime re-
quired for light totravel across the
diameter oftheearth’s orbit. The time-
lagwasfound tobeabout 16.5minutes
orapproximately 1000 seconds. Since
thediameter oftheearth’s orbit isabout
186,000,000 miles, thevelocity oflight
isfound tobe186,000 miles persecond.
The firstdetermination ofthevelocity
oflight over short distances onthe
earthwasmade in1849byA.H.Fizeau.
Hismethod was topassabeam oflight
through one ofthegaps inatoothed
wheel, and reflect itback on itspath
from amirror three orfour milesaway

thesame gapandwas visible onthe
other side.When thewheel wasrotated

thereturn waywasblocked bythenext
tooth. Thetime spent bythewheel in
spinning through thissmall part ofa
revolution, isalsothetime required for
thelight totravel tothedistant mirror
andback again. Hence, knowing these
facts, thevelocity oflight could beeasily
calculated.
Abetter method wasdevised byJ.L.
Foucault in1850,who used arotatingmirror instead ofatoothed wheel. This
method wasused inmore elaborate form
byA.A.Michelson in1926, with an
eight-sided mirror andaconsiderably
increased light path (Fig. 16:8). More
recently, Michelson incollaboration with
others, setupamile-long evacuated tube
with amirror arrangement forcausing
abeam oflight totraverse thispathback
and forthmany times before being ob-
served. Again using arotating-mirror
method, they obtained aquite accurate
value forthevelocity oflight inavac-
uum which wasfound tobeslightly
higher than itsvelocity inair.
Theapproximate values forthevelo-
cityoflight, C,inairare:
C=300,000 kilometres persecond or
3X10^® centimetres persecond
orC=186,000 miles persecond.
The velocity oflight isamost im-
portant physical determination, since it
isthespeed withwhich many forms of
energy travel through space. Itisinter-
esting tonote that thevast distances

IV:7THEORIES OFLIGHT
The first rational attempt toexplain
thepropagation oflightwasmade by
SirIsaac Newton (1642-1728). His
theory, theEmission orCorpuscular
Theory, postulated that light energy
wasconveyed through space byaswiftly
moving stream ofparticles orcorpuscles
shotoutfrom theluminous body. Most
ofthe properties oflightknown at
Newton’s time such asthe rectilinear
propagation oflightand theeffects of
reflection (Chap. 17)and ofrefraction
(Chap. 18)were adequately accounted
forbythistheory.
Arival postulate wasputforward by
Christian Huygens (1629-1695), theson
ofaDutch diplomat and poet. He
sought toexplain thebehaviour oflight
interms ofwaves, andhence histheory
iscalled theWave Theory. Again, re-
flection and refraction were readily
explicable interms ofthiswave theory.
Difficulties were encountered, however,
when seeking toexplain therectilinear
propagation oflight, and also inthe
need forpostulating theexistence ofa
medium, the ether, completely filling
space inwhich thewaves could travel.
As*aresult, thewave theory remained
undeveloped andNewton’s corpuscular
theory wasgenerally accepted.
Early inthe nineteenth century,
Thomas Young (1773-1829), andA.J.
Fresnel (1788-1827), provided valuableexperimental support forthewave theory
oflight. They were able toshow that
twobeams oflight could bemade to
interfere with and toreinforce each
other, thereby producing alternate dark
and bright lines. This could only be
explained by“superposition ofwaves”.
Atoneposition when inopposite phase,
acrest withatrough, these waves pro-
duce adark line. Atanother position
when inthesame phase, acrest with
acrest, oratrough with atrough, they
produce abright line. (Compare with
superposition ofsound waves. Sec. 11:6.)
Another lineofexperimental support
infavour ofthewave theory was to
show thatthevelocity oflight issmaller
inthedenser oftwomedia. The cor-
puscular theory hadpredicted theexact
reverse ofthis.
Recent work seems tofavour acom-
bination ofthecorpuscular andwave
theories intheexplanation ofmany of
theobserved effects. This theory called
theQuantum Theory, was firstdevised
byMax Planck in1901. According to
thistheory, light isemitted bytheatoms
ofaluminous body inseparate packets
orbundles ofenergy called quanta or
photons. Probably oneormore ofthe
electrons revolving about thenucleus
ofanatom (Sec.V :12)canbemade to
jump from one orbit or“energy level”
toanother. Astheydoso,oneormore
quanta ofenergy, orphotons areemit-
ted. This energy radiates from the
luminous body aselectromagnetic waves
(Sec. IV:38).The energy content of
aphoton determines thelength and
frequency ofthewave, andhence the
colour ofthelight observed.

CHAPTER 17 REFLECTION OFLIGHT-
MIRRORS
IV:9THELAWS OFREFLECTION
Insection IV:2,welearned thatmost
objects aremade visible when light
falling onthem isreflected back toour
eyes. The rays oflight that fallupon
abody arecalled incident rays, while
those that aresentback bythebody
arecalled reflected rays.
Amirror isasmooth, highly polished
surface, designed toreflect amaximum
amount oflight. Mirrors usually con-
sistofpieces ofglass silvered onone
surface. Some are flatand arecalled
plane mirrors, while others arecalledFig. 17:1 TheOptical Disc, forDem-
onstrating theLaws ofOptics.
183
Chap. 17 LIGHT
curved mirrors. However, anysmooth
surface, such aspolished metal, polished
wood, or still water, will serve asa
mirror.
Fig.17:2 Reflection ofLight bya
Plane Mirror (a)Using Optical Disc.
(b)Terms.
Tostudy reflection oflightandother
optical phenomena anoptical disc is
used (Fig. 17:1). This consists ofa
circular flat disc,graduated indegrees,
towhich various pieces ofoptical equip-
ment can befastened bymeans of
thumb-screws. The disccanbeturned
about ahorizontal axisbymeans ofa
handle fastened totheback. Surround-
ing the disc isanopaque collar in
which isawindow containing oneor
more horizontal slits.
Mount aplane mirror atthecentre
ofthe disc,with theface ofthemirror
atright angles tothezero linemarked
onthedisc (Fig. 17:2). Allow aray
oflightfrom alantern topassthrough
asingle slitinthewindow oftheoptical
disc sothat itfallsupon themirror.
Adjust sothat thepoint ofincidence
coincides with thepoint where thezero
linemeets themirror. This lineatrightangles tothe reflecting surface and
meeting itatthepoint ofincidence is
called thenormal. Rotate thediscand
thus cause theincident raytostrike the
mirror atdifferent angles. Ineach case
note thedirection ofthereflected ray
andcompare the sizeofangle ofinci-
dence (the angle between theincident
rayand thenormal), with that ofthe
angle ofreflection (the angle between
thereflected rayand thenormal) .In
each case these twoangles willbefound
tobeequal, and theincident ray, the
reflected rayandthenormal will allbe
found tobeintheplane ofthe disc.
Hence wecan state thetwolaws of
reflection asfollows:
FirstLaw:The angle ofreflection al-
ways equals theangle of
incidence
orZr=Zi
Second Law:The incident ray,thenor-
mal,andthereflected ray
alllieinthesame plane.
These laws are quite simple and
straightforward. Weapply them daily
ingames such ashandball, tennis and
basketball where thebounce ofaball
isutilized. Experiment 2,chapter 21,
isanalternative method forproving
these twolaws ofreflection.
IV :10REGULAR AND DIFFUSE
REFLECTION
When parallel rays fallupon a
smooth reflecting surface, such asa
plane mirror, theyform thesame angle
ofincidence with thesurface, and in
consequence they willbereflected asa
beam ofparallel rays (Fig. 17:3a).
Such reflection iscalled regular reflec-
tionand often produces undesirable
glare. Forexample, one finds itdiffi-
cult toread from aglazed paper in
sunlight.
Diffuse orirregular reflection occurs
184
REFLECTION OFLIGHT— MIRRORS Sec.IV:11
when light strikes arough surface (Fig.
17:3b). Such asurface may becon-
sidered tobecomposed ofalarge
number oftiny, flatsurfaces that face
inalldirections. Thus when parallel
rays oflight strike such asurface, the
individual rays arescattered ordiffused
due totheir being reflected indifferent
directions.
Toavoid glare itisoften necessary
topromote diffusion oflight. Unglazed

inourhomes isleftwith adull finish.
These, andother devices, allcause dif-
fuse reflection oflight.
Diffusion, andhence theelimination
ofglare, isalsoobtained bytransmission
oflight through frosted oropalescentlight bulbs, and lamp-shades. Prism
glassandother types ofroughened glass
inwindows serve thesame purpose.
IV :11IMAGES INPLANE MIRRORS
Mirrors havemany andvaried uses.
Large plate-glass mirrors arefrequently
placed onthewalls ofourhomes andof
public rooms togiveanimpression of
spaciousness. Rear-view mirrors arenow
compulsory inallautomobiles. Mirrors
areoften used inscientific instruments
toreflect light onto ascale, inprojec-
tors tointensify the lightbeam, inthe
view-finder ofreflex cameras, inperi-
scopes, and the like. Inview ofsuch
widespread uses, itshould beofreal
interest toustostudy theimages pro-
duced byplane mirrors (Fig. 17:4).
Ondoing experiment 3,chapter 21,
you willlearn thefollowing facts about
images inplane mirrors:
The Position oftheImage. Theimage
isasfarbehind themirror astheobject
isinfront, andalinejoining thetwo
passes through themirror atright
angles.
The Characteristics oftheImage. The
image isthesame size astheobject.

from it.Such animage cannot bepro-
jected onto ascreen. The image is
vertically erect, but laterally inverted.
When wesay “laterally .inverted” we
mean that theright and left sides are
interchanged (Fig. 17:4b).
Note thatwhen themirror ishorizon-
tal,theimage isvertically aswell as
laterally inverted. Recall what youob-
serve onlooking into astillbody of
water toverify this fact.

These phenomena observed experi-
mentally canbeshown tobetrue asa

Only those lying between OAB and
OCD enter thepupil oftheeye after
being reflected from themirror. The
reflected raysABandCDappear tobecoming from I,their point ofinter-
section.
Inorder tolocate theimage ofan
object inaplane mirror geometrically,
thefollowing construction isnecessary
(Fig. 17:6). From each point ofthe
object, draw aperpendicular tothe
mirror, andextend itanequal distance
behind themirror. Join theends ofall
such linesandyou willhaveanoutline

Onlooking into amirror facing a
parallel mirror ontheopposite wall of
aroom, such asisused inbarber shops,
avery largenumber ofimages ofthe
room canbeseen stretching away almost
endlessly. Todiscover how these are
formed study Fig.17:7 carefully.

ceeding image isfainter than theone

inclined mirrors, in1819 invented the

ently shaped pieces ofcoloured glass
placed between them. Many beautiful
andfascinating designs canbeproduced

IV :14CURVED MIRRORS
Curved mirrors arefrequently more
suitable than plane mirrors forcertain
purposes. Curved mirrors areused as
rear-vision mirrors, asshaving mirrors
and asreflectors forcarheadlights.
Oneimportant type ofcurved mirror

surface isaportion ofthesurface of

Secondary Axis,CD, isanyother line

centre ofcurvature, itfollows, that
aNormal tothesurface ofacurved

simply asecondary axis.
Principal Focus, F,isthepoint onthe
principal axis, through which rays,
travelling parallel totheprincipal axis
(and fairly close toit)pass, after
being reflected from themirror. For
aconvex mirror, theprincipal focus
isavirtual focus, and isthat point
from which such raysappear todi-
verge after reflection from themir-
ror. This point willbefound tobe
midway between thecentre ofcurva-
tureand thevertex ofthemirror.
There aremany other foci possible.that is,points through which reflected
light rays areconverged. However,
there isonly one principal focus as
defined.
Focal Length, FV, isthedistance from
theprincipal focus tothevertex of
themirror.
The action ofcurved mirrors (Chap.
21,Exp. 5),may bedemonstrated by
means oftheoptical disc.Mount a
concave mirror ontheoptical disc so
that the0°—0°linebecomes theprin-
cipal axisofthemirror. Insert ametal
shield with several parallel slits inthe
window oftheopaque collar andshine
lightfrom aprojection lantern through
these slitsonto themirror (Fig. 17:12).
You willnote thatthereflected rayscon-
verge. Ifthedisc isrotated sothat the
incident raysareparallel totheprincipal
axis itwillbefound that thereflected
rays converge through apoint. This
point istheprincipal focus ofthemirror.
Similarly, ifweinsert aconvex mirror in
place oftheconcave one,andrepeat the
above, itwillbefound thatthereflected
rays diverge asthough coming from a
point behind themirror. This virtual
point locates theprincipal focus ofthe
convex mirror.

IV:15IMAGES INACONCAVE
MIRROR
Inexperiment 6,chapter 21we
studied thecharacteristics and position
ofimages formed byaconcave mirror
fordifTerent positions oftheobject. As
theobject wasmoved closer tothemir-
ror, theimage, which was realand

inverted, gradually grew larger insize
andmoved farther from the mirror.
When theobject waslocated inside the
principal focus ofthemirror, theimage
became virtual anderectandwaslocated
behind themirror.
Allofthese results canbeverified with
fairaccuracy bymeans ofsimple geo-
metric diagrams. The principles used
here arevery similar tothose used pre-
viously with plane mirrors. Each point
ontheobject issending out rays of
light instraight lines inalldirections.
Ifwetrace thepaths ofseveral ofthese
raysfrom apoint ontheobject, tothe
mirror, and then their reflected rays
backfrom themirror, wewill find that
they intersect. The point ofintersection
isthepoint ontheimage that corres-
ponds totheoriginal pointontheobject
fromwhence the light rayscame.
Suitable rays for this purpose, as
illustrated inFig.17:13, are:1.Arayfrom theobject parallel to
the principal axis, which will be
reflected through theprincipal focus.
2.Arayfrom theobject through the
centre ofcurvature which willbe
reflected back along thesame path,
since theincident ray strikes the
mirror atright angles.
3.Arayfrom theobject through the
principal focus, which willbere-
flected parallel totheprincipal axis.
4.Arayfrom theobject tothevertex
ofthemirror, which willbereflected
sothattheangle ofincidence equals
theangle ofreflection.
5.Any other rayfrom theobject to
themirror willbereflected sothat
Zf=Zr.
Inactual practice anytwo ofthese
rays will suffice. The firsttwomen-
tioned arethemost easily drawn and
hence arethemost convenient touse.
Inorder toverify theobservations
obtained inourexperiment, itisneces-
sary tomake accurate scale drawings.

sufficient.) Draw theimage 111,per-

The student should construct similar
diagrams forother positions ofthe
object, andverify theother observations
made. The special case,where avirtual
image isobtained, isslightly more dif-
ficult. Study thefollowing diagram care-
fully, and note that themethod is
identical tothatgiven previously (Fig.17:15). However, thistime thereflected
rays diverge, and therefore appear to
come from apoint behind themirror,
thereby creating thevirtual image.

!V:18THEMIRROR FORMULAE
Intheprevious sections wehavebeen
studying theimages produced bycurved
mirrors. Itispossible bymeans oftwo
simple formulae todetermine the loca-
tionand characteristics oftheimage for
various positions oftheobject. Todoso,aconsistent convention regarding
signsmust befollowed. Values fordis-
tances ofobjects and realimages are
always positive; those forvirtual images
arenegative. Similarly, thefocal length
ofaconcave mirror (which hasareal
principal focus) ispositive, that ofa
convex mirror (with avirtual principal
focus) isnegative. Tostate thiscon-
cisely, theconvention ofsigns is:
“real ispositive, virtual isnegative”

IV:19APPLICATIONS OFMIRRORS
Reference hasalready beenmade in
section IV :11totheuses ofplane mir-
rors.Many ofthese uses, however, are
more satisfactorily fulfilled byusing
curved mirrors. Forexample, aplane
mirror isfrequently used asashaving
mirror. However, aconcave mirror so
used produces anenlarged erect image
when theface isheldbetween theprin-
cipal focus and thevertex ofthemir-
ror.The enlarged image isoften adistinct advantage. Similarly, aconvex
mirror isfrequently used asarear vision
mirror instead ofaplane mirror. The
erect, smaller image produced gives a
wider field ofview with thesame size
mirror.
Spherical mirrors such aswehave
been describing haveoneserious defect,
known asspherical aberration. Insuch
mirrors, only those rays parallel tothe
principal axisand fairly near toitpass

reflected from themirror. Rays farther
from the principal axis are reflected
through points some distance from the
focus (Fig. 17:19). Conversely, ifa
source oflight isplaced attheprincipal
focus, thereflected rays willnotform a
parallel beam, buttheouter ones willbe
scattered andhence the light isweak-
ened.

From thepreceding observations we
maysummarize thebehaviour oflight
rays inpassing from onemedium into
another ofdifferent optical density, as
follows:
1.When arayoflight passes obliquely
from onemedium intoanother of
greater optical density, itisrefracted
toward thenormal.
2.When arayoflight passes obliquely
from onemedium intoanother of
less optical density, itisrefracted
away from thenormal.Itfollows from theabove thatwhen
arayoflight enters anewmedium at
right angles tothesurface, norefraction
occurs.
IV:22EXPLANATION OF
REFRACTION
Wemay askwhat causes refraction of
light. The following illustration should
help ustounderstand it.Suppose the
brakes ofanautomobile areimproperly
adjusted, thoseontheright wheels hold-
ingbetter than those onthe left.When
thebrakes are applied, thecar will
swerve totheright, that is,totheside
that isslowed upmost. Similarly, the
bending ofthelightbeam, orrefraction,
iscaused bythechange inthevelocity
oflight asitpasses from onemedium
intoanother ofdifferent optical density.
The greater theoptical density ofasub-
stance themore slowly light will travel
through it.
According tothewave theory, light
travels outfrom thesource asspherical
waves. When awave-front enters an
optically denser medium obliquely (Fig.
18:4), that part of itthat enters the
newmedium first willbeslowed, while
the restofitcontinues toadvance at
thesame speed asbefore. Consequently,
thewave-front swerves toward thenor-
mal as itenters thedenser medium.
Conversely, thewave-front would swerve
away from thenormal asitspeeds up
onpassing intoanoptically lessdense
medium. Nobending occurs ifthelight
enters thenewmedium atright angles
tothesurface, fortheentire wave-front
would beslowed down orspeeded up
atthesame instant.

slow velocity. Such substances refract
light toagreater extent thandothose
with asmaller index ofrefraction. The
brilliance ofdiamonds, andother pre-
cious stones islargely due tothis fact
(Sec. IV:26).Theindex ofrefraction
ofasubstance varies with thecolour of
the light that passes through it.The
rainbow and thebeautiful colours ob-
tained when light isrefracted through
cutglassandprecious stones aredue to
this (Sec. IV:37). Temperature, too,

when light passes through air rising

fering .refractive indices ofvarious layers

original slowing down), theemergent
ray willbeparallel totheincident ray
butlaterally displaced (Fig. 18:5). The
amount ofthis lateral displacement de-
pends onthe refractive index ofthe
glass, ontheangle ofincidence, andon
thethickness ofthe glass.Onlooking'
atanobject through suchaplate, itwill
beslightly displaced inposition and will
appear nearer totheeyethan itisin
fact (Fig. 18:6). Thesame thing occurs
inwater and thisaccounts forthe diffi--
culty inlocating theexact position ofan
immersed object (Chap. 21,Exp. 10).
IV:25REFRACTION THROUGH
PRISMS
Aprism consists ofawedge-shaped
portion ofarefracting substance, bound-
edbytwoplane surfaces inclined atan
angle toeach other, this angle being
called therefracting angle. When aray
oflight enters such aprism itisslowed
down, and therefore refracted toward
thenormal. Onleaving, itspeeds up,
andtherefore bends away from thenor-
mal. Thiscanbeshown bymounting a
60°prism onanoptical discandshining
arayofmonochromatic light, e.g., red,
through it.From Fig. 18:7 itisseen

that both these refractions aretoward

erably from itsoriginal path. Theangle
ofdeviation, D,isobtained byextending
theincident andemergent rays tomeet
(Chap. 21,Exp. 11 ).
Theamount ofdeviation produced by
aprism depends upon anumber offac-
tors. First, thematerial comprising the
prism—^thegreater itsindex ofrefrac-
tion, thegreater willbethedeviation
produced. Secondly, theshape ofthe
prism—^^thegreater itsrefracting angle,
thegreater willbetheangle ofdeviation.
Thirdly, theangle ofincidence atwhich
thelight meets theprism. This canbe
shown byrotating theoptical discand
observing theamount ofdeviation for
various angles ofincidence. Minimum
deviation isobtained fromanequilateralprism when the refracted ray passes
through theprism parallel tothebase.
Finally, theamount ofdeviation de-
pends upon the colour, orthewave-
length, ofthelight used, which iswhy
monochromatic lightwasused inthese
experiments. This latter factor gives
prisms oneoftheir large areas ofuse-
fulness. More discussion onthisfollows
inthechapter oncolour, page 213.
IV :26TOTAL REFLECTION
It ismore usual toconsider light
passing from airintoanoptically denser
medium; however, when itgoesfrom
theoptically denser medium into air,
oralessdense medium such asfrom
water orglass into air,apeculiar phe-
nomenon occurs. Asthelight speeds up

when therefracted rayjust grazes the
surface, that is,theangle ofrefraction
equals 90°. This angle ofincidence is
called the critical angle. When the
incident angle exceeds thecritical angle

Alayer ofairentrapped bythecoating

Total reflection isavery useful
phenomenon. Total reflection prisms are
usually right-angled prisms with well-
polished faces. Light enters such aprism
atanangle ofincidence of45°,which is
greater than the critical angle forglass
(p.201), andhence total reflection oc-
curs. Such prisms areused inperiscopes
(Fig. 18:10a), range finders, field-glasses
(Fig, 18:10b), and reflecting telescopes.
They aremuch more efficient reflectors
than mirrors, since mirrors reflect only
about seventy percent ofthelight they
receive, whereas prisms reflect amuch
greater proportion. Inaddition, prisms
aremore robust, there isnosilvering to
tarnish andthey give rise toasingle
well-defined image.
The brilliancy ofdiamonds, brilliants,
and cut-glass dishes isdue tototal re-
flection. The greater theindex ofre-
fraction ofasubstance thesmaller isits
critical angle. Diamonds have alarge
index ofrefraction (Sec. IV:23)and
consequently have asmall critical angle.
The surfaces ofthediamonds meet each
other atsuch angles thatmuch ofthe
light entering adiamond istotally re-
flected anumber oftimes internally,
before eventually being refracted out.
This lights upmany surfaces, and gives
thediamond itssparkle. Brilliants, and
cut-glass articles areoftenmade ofleaded
glass. The addition oflead increases
theindex ofrefraction, andconsequently
thecutfaces areable tocausemuch
total reflection.IV :27ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION

The action ofalens issimilar tothat

Asdiscussed insection IV:25,thelight

Similarly, the light isbenttoward the

theconverging action ofaconvex lens,

Fig.18:14 Terms Pertaining toLenses.
The study oflenses makes useofa
new vocabulary. The terms used are
explained below (Fig. 18:14) :
Centre ofCurvature C, Inmost
lenses there aretwocentres ofcurva-
ture. They arethecentres ofthe
spherical surfaces thatbound thelens.
Principal Axis ofalens isthelinepass-
ingthrough thecentres ofcurvature
ofthetwo faces, or,inthecase ofa
lenswhich hasoneface plane, itis
thelinepassing through thecentre of
curvature ofthecurved faceand
which isnormal totheplane face.
Optical Centre O, isthepoint onthe
principal axismidway between the
twosurfaces ofthelens. Alldistances
along theprincipal axisaremeasured
from thispoint.
Principal Focus F,ofaconvex lens is
that point ontheprincipal axis to
which abeam oflightwhich ispar-
allel totheprincipal axis convergesafter refraction through the lens. (In
aconcave lens, theprincipal focus is
avirtual point, and isthat point on
theprincipal axisfromwhich abeam
oflight, which isparallel totheprin-
cipal axis, appears todiverge on
being refracted through thelens.)
Focal Plane isasurface that passes
through theprincipal focus perpen-
dicular totheprincipal axis ofthe
lens.
Focal Length isthedistance oftheprin-
cipal focus from theoptical centre of
the lens.

This actual path ofthe light through

between thepoint where theincident

shall consider allour lenses tobevery

must firstbedetermined andthen its
distance from theoptical centre ofthe
lensmeasured (Chap. 21,Exp. 12).This
maybedemonstrated byplacing aconvex
lensonanoptical disc. Shine anumber
ofrays, parallel totheprincipal axis,
through the discand note thepoint
through which theyconverge. This point
istheprincipal focus (Fig. 18:16). The
focal length depends upon theindex
ofrefraction ofthelensand itsthickness.Increasing either orboth ofthese in-
creases -.theamount ofbending ofthe
lightand soshortens thefocal length.
The powers oflenses used inmost
optical instruments areusually expressed
interms oftheir focal lengths.
Inoptometry itismore usual todeal
with thepower ofalensrather than its
focal length. The unit ofpower isthe
dioptre, which isthepower ofacon-
verging lens offocal length onemetre
(100 centimetres). The shorter thefocal
length, thegreater thepower ofthe
lens,andaccordingly thepower canbe
related tothe focal length bythe
formula:
r,, X100P(dioptres)
/(cm.)
According toourconvention ofsigns
(Sec.IV:18,andIV:32),aconvex lens
with areal principal focus hasaposi-
tive focal length anda4-power; a
concave lenswith avirtual principal
focus hasanegative focal length and
a—power.
Ifalens isused inadifferent medium,
itsfocal length and therefore itspower
willchange. Thiscanbeshown byplac-
ingalens inatank ofturbid water

beexpected asthere isasmaller de-

ingofthe light, and therefore alonger
focal length. Aconvex airlens inwater
would function asadiverging lens. Ex-
plain why. Itcanbeconstructed by
cementing watch glasses together using a
waterproof cement.
Care should beobserved intheuseand
location ofspherical transparent objects.Forexample, aglass globe ofwater in
sunlight could focus thesun’s rays. If
flammable material should belocated at
theprincipal focus ofthis lens afire
could easily result. Use ismade ofthis

IV:30IMAGES INCONVEX LENSES
Previously wesawhow images were
formed inconcave mirrors (Sec.IV;
15).Convex lenses form avery similar
series ofimages byrefracting the light
that passes through them. Inexperiment
13,chapter 21themethod ofstudying
thecharacteristics and position ofthe
images formed isgiven. Itwillbefound
that astheobject approaches the lens
uptothefocal plane theimage formed
ontheopposite side ofthelens isreal,
inverted, andgradually becomes larger
insizeasitmoves farther from the lens.
When theobject islocated inside the
focal plane, theimage becomes virtual,
erect, and islocated onthesame sideof
thelens astheobject.
Asinmirrors, soinlenses, itispos-
sible toverify these results bymeans of
simple geometric diagrams. Todosoit
isnecessary todraw tworaysfrom any
point onthe object, and determine
through what point they arefocused by
the lens (Fig. 18:19). Thetwomost
suitable rays are;
(1)Arayfrom the tipoftheobject
parallel totheprincipal axis. This
rayonpassing through thelens is
refracted through the principal
focus. ,
(2)Arayfrom the tipoftheobject
through theoptical centre ofthelens. This raymay beconsidered
aspassing straight through the
lens (Sec. IV;28).

Thepoint where thesetworefracted rays
cross locates the tipoftheimage. A
similar construction forother points on
theobject will locate thecorresponding
points ontheimage.
Fig. 18:20 shows how tolocate the
virtual image obtained when theobject
isinside the focal plane ofthe lens.

Theconstruction isidentical tothat just

diverge from each other, itisnecessary

pear tomeet.

IV:33APPLICATIONS OFLENSES
Aslenses areanessential part of
almost every optical instrument, adis-
cussion oftheir major applications is
reserved until chapter 20where several
optical instruments aredescribed. How-
ever, torelate specifically tothe facts
learned inthepreceding sections wewill
mention afewsimple uses here. The
camera (Sec. IV;44), theeye (Sec.
IV:45), the telescope (Sec. IV;48)
andtheprojection lantern (Sec. IV:49)
allcontain aconvex lens asanessential
part oftheir construction. Allthese in-struments produce real, inverted images
because theobject viewed ineach case
isbeyond theprincipal focus ofthelens.
Inthemagnifying glass (Sec. IV;46)
andmicroscope (Sec. IV;47)anen-
larged, erect, virtual image isobtained
because theobject isinside theprincipal
focus oftheconvex lens.Concave lenses
areused along with convex lenses in
many optical instruments toovercome
certain defects, e.g., chromatic aberra-
tion (Sec. IV;42), thatwould beap-
parent iftheconvex lenswere used
alone.

CHAPTER 19 COLOUR
IV:35INTRODUCTION TOCOLOUR
Imagine how drab and uninteresting
theworld would be ifthere were no
colour. Think ofthe pleasure and
stimulation wereceive from thecolours
ofnature—theblue sky,thegreen grass,
thebeautiful flowers, thegorgeous hues
ofthesunrise and sunset. The useof
colour inphotography, inmovies, and in
book illustrations hasadded tremendously
toourenjoyment ofthese things. How
appealing and satisfying aresome ofthe
beautifully coloured mastei-pieces ofart!
Economically too, colour plays avery
important role, asshown bythevaried
colours used inhome decorating, cloth-
ing,advertising, andthe like.
For thousands ofyears men have
known that colourless glass ofcertain
shapes, aswell asfrost, diamonds and
other crystals, produce light ofmany
colours when illuminated bywhite light.
Until thetime ofSirIsaac Newton
everyone supposed that the glass or
crystals produced the light bygiving
something tothelight asitwasreflected
by,ortransmitted through, them. It
washewho, after thorough scientific in-
vestigation arrived atthetrueexplana-
tion ofthenature ofcolour and the
character ofwhite light.IV:36COMPOSITION OFWHITE
LIGHT
(a)Dispersion
In1666,Newton permitted abeam of
sunlight, passing through acircular hole
inawindow blind, tofallonatriangular
glass prism. Hefound thatthelightwas
refracted ordeviated, from itsoriginal
path. Instead ofobtaining asimple
image ofthehole, heobtained aband of
colours which hecalled aspectrum. Its
colours were thesame asthose found in
therainbow—red,orange, yellow, green,
blueand violet, with each colour merg-
ingimperceptibly into the ne.xt (Fig.

19:1). Newton reasoned that white
light must becomposite, that is,made
upofacombination oftheabove col-
ours. The separation ofthecolours by
theprism hecalled dispersion. Afurther
study ofdispersion ismade inexperi-
ment 15,chapter 21.
213
Chap. 19 LIGHT
Asshown inFig.19:1 thisdispersion
occurs because thedifferent colours are
refracted different amounts bytheprism
andaredeviated different amounts from
their original direction. Red isalways
bent theleastfrom itsoriginal direction
and violet themost, with theother
colours intermediate between these.
Aswelearned earlier (Sec. IV;22),
refraction iscaused byachange invelo-
cityoflightonpassing fromonemedium
toanother. Infreespace, orinair,light
ofallcolours travels atthesame rate,
186,000 miles persecond. Onentering
anoptically denser medium such asglass
thelight isslowed down, andonleaving
thismedium itspeeds uptoregain its
original velocity inair.Since thediffer-
entcolours arebent different amounts
bytheprism, itfollows that theymust
be travelling atdifferent velocities
through theprism. Red light, bent the
least,must slowdown theleastonenter-
ingtheprism and therefore speeds up
the leastonleaving. Incontrast, violet
lightmust slowdown themostonenter-
ing,andspeed upthemostonleaving
theprism.
Aquestion thatimmediately arises of
course is,“Why does theprism have this
different effect onthedifferent colours?”
The answer relates back toourwave
theory oflight (Sec. IV:7).The differ-
entcolours oflight result from different
wave-lengths.Red light hasthelongest waves and
violet the shortest, thewave-lengths of
theother colours being between these
two. Evidently, the longer red rays
encounter lessopposition totheir pas-
sagethrough theglass prism and, there-
fore pass through more rapidly than
dotheviolet rays.

*Thewave-length shown foreach col-
our isrepresentative only. Each colour
consists ofwave-lengths thatmerge into
those ofthecolours adjacent toit.For
example, thewave-lengths ofred liebe-
tween 6470Aand7000A.
Colour bears thesame relation tolight
that pitch does tosound. The pitch of
asound depends upon thenumber of
vibrations persecond thatreach theear
(Sec. 11:12). Similarly thecolour of
lightdepends upon thenumber ofvibra-
tions persecond thatreach theeye. In
light, however, since thefrequency isso
great, itiscustomary todescribe thecol-
ourinterms ofwave-lengths, rather than
interms ofvibration frequency.
Example
Calculate thevibration frequency ofred light.
Velocity=3X10^®cm.persec (Sec.IV :6).

(b)ByaConverging Lens, (c)ByNewton's Disc.
(b)Recomposition
Newton further supported histheory
concerning thecomposite nature ofwhite
lightbyshowing that thecolours ofthe
spectrum could berecombined, giving
white light (Chap. 21,Exp. 16).He
firstarranged twoprisms with their re-
fracting edges inopposite directions. On
passing white lightthrough these reversed
prisms, white lightwasobtained through
them. Fig.19:2a shows that the first
prism disperses the colours, while the
second prism recombines them byrevers-
ingtheoriginal refraction andcausing
the light waves tobesuperimposed on
each other.Asimilar effect canbese-
cured byusing aconverging lens to
catch thedispersed coloured lightfrom
aprism. Ifthis light isbrought toa
focus onascreen aspot ofwhite light
willbeobtained (Fig. 19:2b). Ifthe
screen ismoved beyond thefocus, are-
versal ofthe original colours willbe
obtained.Newton alsoprepared acolour discon
which were coloured sectors whose sizes
andcolours corresponded fairly closely to
thecoloured bands obtained inapure
spectrum ofwhite light (Fig. 19:2c).
Ifthis disc isstrongly illuminated and
rapidly rotated itwillappear white. This
phenomenon isdue towhat iscalled
‘the persistence ofvision”. Any visual
impression ontheretina oftheeyeper-
sists forashort period oftime after the
cause hasbeen removed. Itisonthis
principle thatmovies aremade toap-
pear continuous. Inreality, each picture
isthrown onthescreen forafraction
ofasecond, itsimage persisting inour
vision until thenext appears. Similarly,
ifthecoloured disc isrotated rapidly
enough, theimpression produced byone
colour persists, while impressions pro-
duced byalltheother colours are re-
ceived onthesame portion oftheretina.
Thus allthecolours ofthespectrum will
besuperimposed ontheretina, and will
give thesensation ofwhite light.

Therainbow isaspectrum ofsunlight

light entering adrop ofwater isre-
fracted atA(Fig. 19:3a), theviolet rays
being refracted more than theredrays.

The refracted light istotally reflected

thedifferent colours aredispersed. Each
drop ofwater forms itsown little spec-
trum. Intheactual bowwhich the
observer sees, theredrayscome atan
angle of42°from drops ofwater higherinthesky,andtheviolet rayscome atan
angle of40°from drops ofwater lower
inthesky (Fig. 19:3b). The other
colours come from drops between these
angles. Therainbow hastheshape ofa
bow, since theeyeoftheobserver isat
theapex ofaconefrom which hesees
thecoloured rays refracted from drops,
allofwhich must subtend approximately
thesame angle attheeye(between 40°
and42°).
Sometimes alarger, but fainter sec-
ondary bow isseenabove theprimary.
The colours initarereversed, theviolet

thelower part ofthewater drops, is
refracted, andtwice totally reflected be-
fore itleaves thedrop (Fig. 19:3c).
The light isrefracted from thedrops of
water atangles offrom 51°to54°.The
double reflection notonly reverses the
colours, butalsoabsorbs more light thus
causing thesecondary bow tobefainter
than theprimary bow.
IV :38BEYOND THEVISIBLE
SPECTRUM
Sofarinourstudy ofthespectrum we
have considered only those radiations to
which theeye issensitive. Actually the
spectrum ofsunlight extends wellbeyond
itsvisible limits. SirWilliam Herschel,
in1800, onplacing theblackened bulb
ofathermometer inthevarious parts of
thespectrum, discovered that theheat-
ingeffect observed attheredendwas
continued when thethermometer was
placed wellbeyond thevisible limit.He
thus indicated theexistence ofawide
range ofinvisible radiation beyond the
redend ofthespectrum (Sec. 111:15).
These infra-red radiations, asthey are
called, convey almost half ofthesun’s
total outpouring ofenergy into space.
They canpenetrate mist,smoke andhaze
andhence arevery suitable fordistance

graphy inthedark, and detection of

other aches andpains.
The year following Herschel’s dis-
covery oftheinfra-red, Ritter discover-
ed,by itsaction inblackening certain
silver salts, aband ofinvisible radiation
beyond theviolet, called theultra-violet.
Ultra-violet raysdohave special photo-
graphic effects, andalsomake some sub-
stances such asvaseline andcertain min-
erals “fluoresce” orgiveout“cold light”.
They have ahighly beneficial effect
onhealth, accelerating themanufacture
ofvitamin Dunder the skin. These
ultra-violet rays are easily absorbed by
mist, smoke and ordinary glass. Con-
sequently, one readily recognizes thevalue ofaholiday away from the city.
For ultra-violet treatment onemust be
exposed directly tothesun’s rays, oruse
windows ofspecial “vita glass” which
istransparent tosome ultra-violet rays.
Proper precautions must betaken as
overtreatment canproduce severe sun-
burn, aswell asdamage totheretina of
theeye. Ultra-violet lamps simply con-
sistofcarbon ormercury electrodes be-
tween which anelectric current produces
anarc.Such lamps areusually fitted
with quartz lenses which aretranspar-
enttotheultra-violet rays.

discussed above inconnection with the
solar spectrum, there exist other invisible
radiations such asradio waves, X-rays,
andgamma rays (rays emitted byradio-
active substances). Allthese different
radiations arepropagated aswaves with
thesame velocity aslight, thedifference
intheir properties being due totheir
different wave-lengths. The relationship
between these various electromagnetic

IV:39SPECTRUM ANALYSIS
The spectroscope isanimportant in-
strument bymeans ofwhich thespectra
ofluminous bodies canbeproduced and
measured. Itconsists ofatube called
thecollimator (Fig. 19:5), atoneend
ofwhich isaconvex lensand atthe
other endanadjustable vertical slit.The
length ofthetube isequal tothefocal
length ofthecollimator lens, sothat
when the slit isilluminated bylight
from thesource, S,under examination,
aparallel beam canbedirected onto a
prism situated onasmall turn-table at
thecentre oftheinstrument. The dis-
persed beams produced bytheprism are
received byatelescope focused forpar-
allel light and fitted with cross-wires.
This telescope canbemoved round a
circular scale against which thedevia-
tions oftheconstituent parts ofthespec-
trum formed canbemeasured. The
examination inthisway ofthe light
from different luminous bodies reveals
thateach spectrum ischaracteristic of
thesource, andastudy ofthese spectra
yieldsmuch valuable information tothe
physicist and astronomer. Accordingly
weshall briefly consider heresome of
themore important spectra andtheir sig-
nificance (Fig. 19:6),
Continuous Spectra: These consist of
anumber ofcoloured bands each shad-
ing offgradually into thenext. Theyareproduced byincandescent solids,
e.g.,arc-lamps, white-hot iron, etc.
Line Spectra: Incandescent gases and
vapours emit lightwhich when analysed
produces spectra consisting ofanumber
ofwell-defined coloured lines orcol-
oured images ofthe slit.Each element
has itsown characteristic linespectrum
which provides acertain andaccurate
means ofidentifying theelement (Exp.
17,Chap. 21).Thepresence ofeven a
minute quantity ofanelement inamix-
turecanbedetected byspectroscopic
analysis, and itisinteresting tonote
that themethod hasbeen themeans of
discovering new elements. Ifthespec-
trum ofasubstance contains lineswhich
donotcorrespond with those ofany
known element, theobvious conclusion
isthat there ispresent anelement as
yetnotknown. Inthiswaytheelements
caesium andrubidium were discovered
byBunsen.
Line spectra canbeproduced bythe

stances which are easily vaporized.

crossed bydark lines inthisway iscalled
anabsorption spectrum, and itwasfound
that allsubstances when interposed in
thepath oflight originating from a
higher temperature source absorb from it
light ofthesame wave-length that they
themselves emit.
The Solar Spectrum isanabsorption
spectrum containing hundreds ofdark
lines carefully studied byFraunhofer in
1814. These lines aredue toselective
absorption from theradiation emanating
from theextremely hotcore ofthesun
bythe relatively cooler gases inthe
sun’s atmosphere. Most ofthe lines
have been found tocorrespond tolines
inthespectra ofelements present onthe
earth, andwehave thusgood grounds
forbelieving that thechemical com-
ponents ofthesunandtheearth are
similar. Acertain group oflines did
notcorrespond with those ofanyknown
element. They were accordingly attri-
buted toanelement which wasnamed
helium, andwhich was ultimately dis-
covered ontheearth twenty-six years
later. The constitution ofthe stars is
determined inasimilar wayfrom an
examination oftheir absorption lines.
IV :40NATURE OFCOLOUR
(a)Colour
Wehave already established that
colour isaproperty oflightwaves (Sec.IV;36). Itmay bedefined generally,
astheresponse ofvision todifferent
wave-lengths oflight. Colour isthe al-
phabet inourvisual language, through
which wemake interesting ourdescrip-
tion ofthings andideaswhich otherwise
would bedulland prosaic. Our present
knowledge and useofcolour isbased
largely onthesciences ofpsychology,
chemistry, and physics.
Psychology considers colour through
thephysical operation oftheeyeand
themental impression created bycolour
onthebrain. Asaresult, theactual
perception ofcolour isahighly personal
experience which maybeinfluenced by
such factors ashealth, fatigue and re-
sponse oftheeye tocolour (colour-
blindness). According topsychologists
theaverage person recognizes four dis-
tinct primary colours, red, yellow, blue
and green. Colours dohave astrong
influence onpeople. Tensions canbe
heightened orrelaxed through achange
incolour harmonies; afeeling ofwarmth
orcoldness canbeobtained bycolour
schemes used; colour canbestimulating
orrestful, itcanattract oritcan repel.
Chemistry deals with theproduction
ofmaterials which have the ability to
absorb orreflect part ofthelightwhich
fallsupon them. These arechiefly dyes
andpigments. Theexplanation forthe
colours ofthese materials isgiven inpart
(b)below.
Physics deals with colour from the
standpoint ofdifferences inwave-lengths
ofthecoloured lights, and the effects
ofsuperimposing these ononeanother.
The additive theory ofcolour toexplain
these effects isdiscussed inpart (c)
below.
These three colour theories arethe
basis forourmodern usage ofcolour.
Though separate, they arealso interde-
pendent. Therange andintensity ofthe
colours weseedepend upon thequality
andquantity oflight, thenature ofthe

surface visible, andour ability tosee
andinterpret what meets oureyes.
(b)Colour ofObjects—
The Subtractive Theory
There arethree colours, yellow, red,
and blue, which inpigments arethe
source ofallother colours. Bymixing
these three colours inthe right pro-
portion, allother colours may beob-
tained. Nomixture ofother colours
willproduce anyofthese three colours.
For thisreason yellow, red,andblue are
called primary colours. Acolour chart
hasbeen prepared (Fig. 19:9) inwhich
these primary colours areplaced the
same distance apart along theedge of
thecircle. Mixing anytwoprimary col-
ours produces athird colour called a
binary colour which isintermediate be-
tween those primaries, e.g.,yellow and
redproduce orange. Various hues can
beproduced bymixing abinary colour
with aprimary colour used inmaking
thebinary, e.g.,yellow andorange pro-
duce yellow orange. Certain colours
seem tostrengthen each other when
they areseen together, andhence are
said tobecomplementary toeach other.
Inthechart thecolours ontheopposite
sides ofthecircle arecomplementary.
White isthetotal addition ofcolour,and not, asoften believed, theabsence
ofcolour. Itisproduced when asurface
reflects allcolours equally. Black, onthe
other hand, isperceived when asurface
absorbs allcolours and reflects none.
Colour, then, isthe result ofpartial
absorption, andconsequent subtraction,
ofaband ofcolour from thespectrum.
The surface ofanobject willappear
redwhen itisofsuch nature that it
absorbs allbuttheredwave-lengths of
thespectrum, and reflects these red
wave-lengths (Chap. 21,Exp. 18).When
wemix pigments, each one subtracts
certain colours from white light, and
theresulting colour depends upon the
light that isnotabsorbed. Forexample,
ifwemixabluepigment with ayellow
onewegetagreen colour. The blue
subtracts orabsorbs allcolours from
white light, except green, blueand vio-
let,while theyellow subtracts allexcept
green, yellow andorange. Green isthe
only colour notsubtracted byeither pig-
ment. For thisreason thetwopigments
produce green.
Similarly, transparent objects areable
toabsorb orsubtract certain colours
from white light. Ifwhite light ispass-
edthrough apiece ofred glass, the
glass absorbs alllight except red,and a
little orange, andweobtain red light
(Fig. 19:10a). Objects that aretrans-
parent toonly one colour are called
colour filters. The combination ofa
yellow andablue filter placed over a
single white light source will result in
agreen lightbecause allexcept thegreen
wave-lengths ofthespectrum have been
absorbed (Fig. 19:10b). Similarly a
combination ofthree filters, each cor-
responding toaprimary colour, will
absorb allthecolours andallow prac-
tically nolight topass (Fig. 19:10c).
(Chap. 21,Exp. 18).
The lightwhich fallsupon anobject
can alsodetermine itscolour. Ifthe
light does notcontain allthecolours of

thespectrum then thetruecolour ofthe
object willnotbeobserved. The light
given offbyalight bulb does notcon-
tain allthecolours found insunlight.
For thisreason anarticle ofclothing
mayappear quite different inthesun-
light thanwhen seen under artificial
light.
(c)Coloured Lights—
TheAdditive Theory
Having produced different coloured
lights bytheuseoffilters, twoormore
ofthesemay beadded together topro-
duce stillother colours. The three col-
ours, red,green and blue, which com-
bine toproduce white are called the
three primary colours for lights. None
ofthese primary colours canbepro-
duced byadding other colours oflights.
However, anyother colour canbepro-duced byaproper combination ofthem
(Fig. 19:11). Forexample, redand
blue lightwhen combined produce vio-
let;redandgreen lightadded together

ditive Theory).

willproduce yellow, and soon.The
colour resulting from thesimple com-
bination ofeach pair ofprimary colours
iscomplementary tothethird primary;
forexample, violet iscomplementary to
green, andyellow iscomplementary to
blue. Ifwesuperimpose these com-
plementary coloured lightsweagain get
white light.
Contrast how colour isobtained in
mixing pigments withhow itisobtained
inmixing coloured lights. Intheformer
theresulting colour istheonenotab-
sorbed orsubtracted byeither pigment
(the subtractive effect);inthelatter the
resulting colour isobtained byadding
theeffect oftheindividual colours (the
additive effect). Bothmethods arewidely
used inindustry. Themixing ofpig-
ments toproduce our multi-coloured
paints, themany vegetable andsynthetic
dyes fortreating fabrics, textiles, etc.,
andtheuseoffilters inphotography, all
areapplications ofthesubtractive effect
mentioned above. The additive effect is
applied intheuseofcoloured spotlights
toilluminate actors onstage, orpartici-
pants inacarnival orpageant, aswell
astoproduce changing andspectacular
effects intheillumination ofNiagara
Falls and insome ofthecoloured ad-
vertising that issocommon nowadays.
Colour isoftremendous importance
inindustry. Itsuseinadvertising has
beenmentioned above. Bright contrast-
ingcolours ofpaint onwalls, floors, and
machinery notonlyprovide better visual
conditions but alsoboost morale, speed
upproduction, and affect safety re-
cords. Colour codes areused inbusi-
ness forinvoicing, inelectrical indus-
tries todenote polarity, voltage, resis-
tance, and the like,and inshipping to
encourage dueprecautions inthehan-
dling ofdangerous articles. All, of
course, arefamiliar with itsuseintraffic
control.(d)Colour Vision
Theway inwhich light ischanged
intothesensation ofsight isnotdefinitely
known. The most widely accepted
theory, theYoung-Helmholtz theory,
states there are three sets ofcolour
nerves inthenormal eye.One ofthese
setsofnerves responds only toblue light,
another settogreen light, andthethird
settored light. Thecolour ofanobject
isdetermined bytherelative degree of
stimulation ofeach type ofnerve.
Asmall proportion ofmen (about
3/2%) andwomen (about ^2%), do
nothave allthree ofthese setsofcolour
nerves andhence theydonotreceive the
same sensation ofcolour from anobject
asaperson with allthree setsofcolour
nerves. Such people aresaid tobecol-
ourblind. Bythiswedonotmean that
theydonot seecolour inobjects, but
that theydonot seethesame colours
asaperson withnormal eyes. This defect
isinherited through themother; it
usually exists from birth; and there is
noknown cure for it.
Because acolour-blind person sees a
different colour pattern inalandscape
from thepattern seen byaperson
having normal vision, colour-blind ob-
servers arevery efficient indetecting
camouflage andaresousedduring wars.
Some colour-blind persons areunable to
distinguish redsand greens from each
other and, consequently, have real dif-
ficulty with traffic signals.
IV:41COLOUR PRINTING
Most ofthecoloured pictures inbooks
andmagazines aremade byusing four
separate printing-plates, each plate print-
ingadifferent coloured inkonwhite
paper—yellow, red,blueand black, in
that order. The plates aremade from
fourphotographic negatives ofthesame
subject. These negatives aremade
through fine-meshed coloured filters.
223
Chap. 19 LIGHT
each stained with one ofthe three
primary colours (the black one isnot
actually used inthecreation ofthe
coloured picture inFig.19:12). The
fine-meshed filter breaks thesubject into
numerous small dotsonthenegative. The
filter determines what colours can pass
through thecamera andbecome recorded
onthenegative. Thus dots representing
only certain colours arerecorded oneach
negative. The first plate reproduces the
dots ofthe firstnegative inyellow ink
onwhite paper. Thesecond plate repro-
duces those ofthesecond negative in
redinkonorbetween theyellow dots,
etc.The final effect isoneofindividual
andoverlapping dots ofcolour. Where
adot ofonecolour overlaps adot of
another colour anew colour may be
obtained. The eyeblends these dots of
thefour original andthemixed colours
togive thetotal effect.
IV:42CHROMATIC ABERRATION
Since theaction ofaconvex lens is
similar tothat oftwoprisms with their
bases incontact (Sec. IV:28), inci-
dent rays, inaddition tobeing deviated
toform aconvergent beam will be
dispersed onpassing through the lens.
The various colours arebrought todif-
ferent fociontheprincipal axis, the
focus for violet rays being nearer the
lens than that for red rays (Fig.

light ofdifferent colours isknown as
chromatic aberration. Byusing two re-
versed prisms, one ofcrown glassand

struments.

CHAPTER 20 OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS
IV :44THECAMERA
Thephotographic camera isessentially
anenclosed boxorbellows chamber with
anopening oraperture inthe front
through which light from anobject
passes. The image isrecorded ona
light-sensitive material attheback.
(a)History
The evolution ofthecamera iscre-
dited tomen likeRoger Bacon, 1267,
andLeonardo daVinci, 1519,who de-
scribed and developed the pin-holecamera. Baptista Porta, 1553, and
Johann Kepler, 1604, lateradded alens
andthenacombination oflenses. From
these simple beginnings havecomemany
types ofcameras ranging from therela-
tively inexpensive family-type cameras,
through themore expensive press and
movie cameras, upinto thehighly spe-
cialized cameras used intelevision and
inaerial photography.
(b)Structure
Allcameras areconstructed onthe
same basic principles aswere the first
crude, wooden, box-cameras. The essen-
tialparts ofacamera (Fig. 20:1) are:
1.Alight-tight boxorbellows.
2.Alens toform theimage onthe
film.
3.Ashutter (anddiaphragm) tocon-
226
OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS Sec.IV;45
trol theamount oflight that is
admitted tothefilm.
4.Anegative holder orcarrier tohold
films inposition during exposure.
5.Aview-finder orground glass to
determine picture area.
Bytheaddition ofspecial accessories
andother refinements, the utility and
scope ofthecamera may beextended
tomeet almost anyphotographic re-
quirement.
(c)Focusing
Inorder tofocus objects atdifferent
distances from thecamera, the lens is
often attached toabellows sothat it
may bemoved nearer tothelight-sensi-
tive plate orfilm, orfarther away. In
section IV :30welearned that asthe
object ismoved nearer toaconverging
lens, thereal inverted image gradually
moves farther away from the lens.This
should indicate how tofocus thecamera.
Fordistant objects thelens ismoved so
that thesensitive plate islocated atits
principal focus. For close objects, the
lens ismoved away from the sensitive
film, fornowtheimage isfocused beyond
theprincipal focus ofthe lens. Most
cameras include afocusing scaleonthe
lensmount oronthebedofthecamera
andmany have built-in range finders to
assist infocusing.
(d)Light Control
Ashasbeen indicated previously the
film orplate inacamera contains ma-
terials which aresensitive tolight. The
plate iscoated with anemulsion con-
sisting ofgelatine andasilver salt.Light
decomposes this silver saltsothatwhen
“developed” and “fixed” anegative is
obtained consisting ofadark deposit of
silver inplaces corresponding tothe
light parts oftheoriginal image, and
light transparent portions inpositions
corresponding tothedarker parts of
theoriginal image.One sees, therefore, that itisneces-
sary tobeable tocontrol theamount of
light that enters thecamera. This is
done intwoways
:(1)bycontrolling the
sizeoftheaperture oropening through
which thelight enters; and (2)byregu-
lating thelength oftime thatthelight is
permitted toenter. Theformer isac-
complished byusing avariable dia-
phragm behind the lenswhich enables
theaperture tobevaried, andthelatter
bymeans ofashutter, which isadelicate
mechanical device, often consisting ofa
number ofoverlapping thinmetal blades,
held inposition bymeans ofsprings. On
being released ortripped, when taking a
picture, theshutter opens and closes for
ameasured time interval.
When using asmall aperture alonger
exposure isrequired than with alarge
one. Itiswise practice touseassmall
anaperture aspossible asthispermits
using thecentral part ofthelensonly,
andprevents errors due toinaccuracies
near theedges ofthe lens. Also greater
depth offocus isobtained, that is,objects
atrelatively smaller and greater dis-
tances from thecamera will still be
sufficiently infocus tolook clear inthe
print.
IV:45THEHUMAN EYE
The eye isthesense organ enabling
light tobeperceived. This, themost
wonderful ofalloptical instruments, can
becompared inmany respects toacam-
era(Fig. 20:2).
(a)Structure andAction
The eyeball isapproximately spherical
inshape andslightly lessthanoneinch in
diameter (Fig. 20:3). The wall ofthis
sphere iscomposed oftwomajor layers:
(1)theouter covering, thesclerotic coat,
isatough opaque white substance
forming thewhite oftheeye.The front
portion ofthis sclerotic coat forms a
transparent, curved section called the
227
Chap. 20 LIGHT

cornea that protects theeyeand aids
inrefracting light. (2)Theinner layer,
thechoroid coat, isblack toprevent
internal reflection and toprotect the
light-sensitive parts ofthe eye. It is
also largely nutritive infunction. The
aqueous andvitreous humours arejelly-
likematerials filling thespaces within
the eyeball, which help tokeep its
spherical shape.
Behind thecornea isacoloured dia-
phragm called the iris.This isreally an
Fig.20:3 TheStructure oftheEye.extension ofthechoroid coat, and its
colour ismainly due tothevariable
amounts ofpigment init.Inthecentre
ofthe iris isacircular aperture, called
thepupil, which appears black due to
theblack interior oftheeye.The iris
contains muscles, which dilate andcon-
tract thepupil adjusting theeye to
different amounts oflight. Thepupil is
dilated indim light, andcontracted in
bright light. This action occurs invol-
untarily, i.e.,without any control on
our part, andhence iscalled the iris
reflex. Tonote itsaction, stand infront
ofamirror inadarkroom forseveral
minutes. Then turnonthe lightand
note theimmediate contraction ofthe
pupil. Optometrists usedrugs, such as
atropine, totemporarily dilate thepupil
andpermit internal examination ofthe
eye.
Behind thepupiland iris isthecrystal-
line lens.This isatransparent structure,
made upofnumerous concentric layers,
increasing indensity toward themiddle.

OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS Sec.IV:45
Distant Vision (b)Close Vision.
The curvature of itsfront surface is
considerably lessthan that oftheback
surface. Both ofthese features tend
todiminish distortion oftheimage. The
lens isencased inanelastic capsule and
isheld inplace bysuspensory ligaments
which areattached tothechoroid coat.
These ligaments hold thelensunder a
certain tension sothat itnormally
tends tobeflattened andadjusted for
distant vision. Inthechoroid layer near
thesuspensory ligaments aresmall cili-
arymuscles. The contraction ofthese
muscles tends torelieve the tension
exerted bythesuspensory ligaments on
thelenswhich therefore becomes more
convex and soadjusted forclose vision.
Theadjustment ofthe lens toform a
sharp image onthe retina iscalled
accommodation (Fig. 20:4). The nor-
maleyecanaccommodate itself toob-
jects ranging from infinity toapoint
about twenty-five centimeters orten
inches from theeye.This latter point is
known asthenearest point ofdistinct
vision. Objects closer totheeyethanthiscannot beclearly focused bythe
unaided eye.
The retina istheinnermost layer of
theeyeand issensitive tolight. The
retina iscomposed ofvisual cells, nerve
cells,andthefibres which connect these
andconduct thenerve impulses tothe
brain. The visual cells areoftwotypes,
called rodsandcones, sonamed because
oftheir characteristic rodand cone
shapes. The rods areconcerned with
colourless anddim-light vision, while the
cones handle colour and bright-light
vision. The nerve cells integrate and
relay theimpulses which they receive,
totheoptic nerve, andthrough itto
the brain. That part ofthe retina
where theoptic nerve enters theeye, is
insensitive tolightand isknown asthe
blind spot. Itsexistence canbereadily
demonstrated asshown inFig. 20:5.
Themost sensitive part oftheretina is
asmall yellow spotlocated ontheprinci-
pal axis ofthe lens.Anobject being
viewed isautomatically focused onthis
area.

(b)Defects ofVision andTheir
Correction
Inview ofthedelicate adjustments
made byoureyesandthewayweabuse
them these days with excessive reading,
watching movies, television, etc., itis
only natural thatmany abnormalities or
defects develop. Here, however, weare
only concerned with defects orerrors
caused byrefraction oflight.
When aneyewithnorefractive error
isatrest, parallel rays oflight are
focused exactly onthe retina. Many
eyes,owing toabnormalities ofthe re-
fracting mechanism, donotfocus the
light exactly ontheretina. Such defects
oftheeyecaninlargemeasure beover-
come with the aid ofsuitable lenses
(spectacles).
/.Near-sightedness
Persons suffering from thisdefect are
unable tofocus ondistant objects dis-
tinctly, although objects close tothe
eyes areclearly seen. This isduetothe
axis oftheeyeball being toolong or
thecrystalline lensbeing toopowerful,
sothat raysfrom adistant object tend
tobefocused infront oftheretina (Fig.
20:6a). This defect islargely heredi-
tary, but isalso aggravated bytoo
strenuous use oftheeyes during the
early years. Concave lenses placed in
front oftheeyewillmake thelightmore
divergent andbring theimage toafocus
ontheretina.
2.Far-sightedness
Afar-sighted person cannot seeclearly
objects close totheeyealthough distant
objects may bedistinctly seen. The
defect isdue totheaxis oftheeyeball
being tooshort orthe crystalline lens
not sufficiently converging sothat rays
from anearby object tend toconverge
toapoint behind the retina (Fig.
20:6b). Itisthemostcommon ofre-
fractive errors oftheeyesand ispresenttosome degree inabout two-thirds of
alladults. Convex lenses placed infront
oftheeyewillreduce thedivergence of
therayswhich canthen befocused on

inclined tothem areblurred and indis-
tinct (Fig. 20:6c). Forexample, an
astigmatic eyemay clearly discern all
the vertical lines ofabuilding, while
those inahorizontal plane arescarcely
perceived. Themain cause ofthisdefect
isthelack ofsphericity ofthecornea, in
which thevertical section isfrequently
more curved than thehorizontal. To
overcome thedefect cylindrical lenses are
used toassist refraction intheplane of
least curvature ofthecornea. Astigma-
tism ispresent tovarying degrees in
most eyes.
4.Presbyopia
This isadefect ofageresulting from
the loss ofaccommodation brought
about byhardening ofthe crystalline
lens, orofthe ciliary muscles. It is
evidenced byboth nearand farobjects
being indistinct. Clear vision bytheun-
aided eye ispossible over only avery
restricted range. Two pairs ofspectacles
arerequired bysuch people, one pair
(convex) forreading, andanother pair
(concave) fordistant vision. Both pur-
posesmaybeserved byapair ofbifocal
lenses, thetoppart being used fordis-
tance, andthelower part forreading.
IV :46THEMAGNIFYING GLASS
The apparent size ofanobject de-
pends ontheangle itsubtends atthe
eye. This angle isknown asthevisual
angle oftheobject, and inorder tosee
asmall object clearly one instinctively
brings itclose totheeye,with conse-
quent increase initsvisual angle. With
theunaided eyethere is,however, alimit
towhich this process canbecarried.
This isreached when theobject isatthe
nearest point ofdistinct vision (normally
25cm.or10in.) atwhich position the
object isseenmost clearly. Ifbrought
within thisnatural limit theeyecannot
accommodate itself tothewidely diverg-ingraysfrom theobject without undue
strain. With theuseofashort-focus
convex lens, however, itispossible to
bring theobject even closer, thereby
enabling ittobeseen stillmore distinctly
without straining the eye.The object
isplaced inside thefocus ofthe lens
atsuch aposition that theeyefocuses
themagnified virtual image formed at
thenearest point ofdistinct vision. The
path oftheraysbywhich theeye sees
theimage isshown inFig. 20:7.

IV :47THECOMPOUND MICROSCOPE
Thecompound microscope isvery
widely used toproduce great magnifica-
tions ofsmall objects. The instrument
(Fig. 20:8a) consists mainly ofaconvex
lens ofshort focal length, called the
objective, O,andasecond convex lens,
called theeyepiece, E.These lenses are
mounted inatube ofadjustable length.
The object, PQ, tobeviewed isplaced
justoutside theprincipal focus, F,ofthe
objective (Fig. 20:8b). Thisproduces a
realmagnified image oftheobject at
P'Q,', and thisimage falls inside the
American Optical Company (Canada) Ltd.
(a)
Fig.20:8 TheCompound Microscope.principal focus, F',oftheeyepiece which
acts asasimple magnifying glass.
Through this lens theeye seesalarge
virtual image,pq,when thelength of
thetube isproperly adjusted sothat the
image issharply infocus atthenearest
point ofdistinct vision. Aswith the
magnifying glass, the position ofthe
virtual image depends upon theaccom-
modation oftheobserver’s eye.
The magnification produced bythe
compound microscope isobtained intwo
stages. Both lenses individually produce
amagnified image, sothat the total
magnification istheproduct ofthetwo.
Microscopes forvisual usecanbecon-
structed togive magnifications of2000
and above, thehigher magnifications
being obtained byusing objective lenses
ofvery short focal length. Often such
lenses aredesigned toemploy amedium
ofcedar oilbetween thespecimen and
the objective (Oil-Immersion Micro-
scopes). Thismedium increases the
light-gathering power and theresolving
power oftheobjective byreducing reflec-
tionandscattering oflight atthesurface
ofthe lens. Single lenses ofvery short
focal length give images which are

greatly distorted, andwhich have col-
oured edges. Toavoid thistheobjec-
tives ofactual microscopes areusually
compound achromatic lenses (Sec.
IV:42).
Microscopes generally have aconcave
mirror, and frequently acondensing
lensabove it,tofocus sufficient lighton
theobject being examined. The inven-
tion ofthemicroscope in1590 by
Zacharias Janssen, with themany im-
provements added since then, hascon-
tributed immensely totheadvances
made inmedicine and public health,
aswell asrevealing many marvels of
plant andanimal life,andhidden secrets
ofthemineral kingdom.
IV:48THETELESCOPE
(a)Refracting Telescope
Themethod bywhich thetelescope
works issimilar tothat ofthemicro-
scope. The refracting telescope consistsofanarrangement oftwoconvex lenses
forviewing very distant objects (Chap.
21,Exp. 19),The objective should have
avery great focal length, forthegreater
the focal length the larger will be
theimage ofanobject atinfinity. It
should alsobeoflarge diameter toen-
able amaximum amount oflight to
becollected, thereby producing abrighter
image. This lens willproduce areal
inverted image at itsprincipal focus.
This should belocated justwithin the
principal focus oftheeyepiece through
which theeye seesamagnified virtual
image (Fig. 20:9).
The magnifying power ofthe tele-
scope isapproximately equal tothefocal
length, F,oftheobjective divided by
thefocal length,/,oftheeyepiece.
Magnifying power=—

(h)Reflecting Telescope
Reflecting telescopes areused forastro-
nomical purposes. The objective isa
parabolic mirror (Sec. IV;19)which
collects light from the distant object.
Since thelight isreflected back toward
theobject, ameans ofviewing theimage
withaneyepiece necessitates theuseof
anadditional mirror orprism (Fig.
20 :10).
Large reflecting telescopes include the
74inchdiameter telescope attheDavid
Dunlap Observatory atRichmond Hill,
Ontario, andthe72inch telescope atthe
Dominion Astro-Physical Observatory
near Victoria, British Columbia. Largertelescopes ofthis type arelocated at
Mount Wilson, California (100 in.)and
atPalomar Mountain, California (200
in. ).This latter isthelargest telescope in
theworld, having onemillion times the
light-gathering power ofthehuman eye.
(c)Terrestrial Telescope
The drawback totheastronomical
telescope isthat theimage isinverted.
Forobserving familiar terrestrial objects
atelescope requires animage-erecting
system. The simplest means ofobtaining
this istoinsert athird convex lens to
re-invert theimage (Fig. 20:11). Such
terrestrial telescopes areused bysur-
veyors, bymariners andbymilitary men.

For thisinstrument avery powerful
light source isneeded. This isplaced at
thecentre ofcurvature ofaconcave
reflector (mirror) M,sothatmany rays
thattend tobelost,onhitting thismir-
rorare reflected back onthemselves
thereby intensifying thelight source. It

asaresult produces areal, enlarged,
andinverted image onthescreen. The
slide isalways inserted upside down in
the carrier, sothat itsimage willbe
erect onthescreen, /.The sizeofthe
imagemaybeincreased byincreasing the
distance between theprojector and the
screen. The objective iscontained ina
moveable mount, topermit focusing the
image fordifferent distances ofprojec-
tion. Optically themotion-picture pro-
jector and slide projector aresimilar.

CHAPTER 22 MAGNETISM
V;1INTRODUCTION TOMAGNETISM
The Study ofmagnetism began with
theobservation ofthepower ofattrac-
tion oflodestone for iron. Lodestone
isthemineral magnetite, anoxide of
iron, which was first discovered inthe
province ofMagnesia (from which the
name magnet was derived) inAsia
Minor. Deposits ofthismineral are
found inmany other parts oftheworld
including large areas ofCanada and
theUnited States.
The original discovery ofmagnetite is
recorded inanancient legend which
tells ofaCretan shepherd whose iron-
tipped crook was sostrongly drawn to
theearth thathedug tofindthecause.
Fables tellofmagnetic rocks covered
ontheir seaward sides with nailsdrawn
from passing ships, and ofiron statues
supported inmid air.
Forcenturies menhavebeen intrigued
bythephenomena ofmagnetic prop-
erties. Inthewritings ofLucretius, a
Roman who died in52b.c., thefollow-
ingreference isfound:
“And iron filings inthebrazen bowls
seethe furiously; when underneath
was setthemagnet stone.”
Itwas intheperiod oftheRenaissancewhen William Gilbert, physician to
Queen Elizabeth IofEngland, published
hisfamous andhitherto unequalled book
entitled DeMagnete. Inhisbook Gil-
bert emphasized theimportance of
scientific method, and ofarriving at
conclusions only after careful experi-
ment. Hededicated hiswork “toyou
alone, truephilosophers, ingenious minds,
who notonly inbooks but inthings
themselves look forknowledge.”
DeMagnete laid thefoundation of
magnetic science. Itdescribed indetail
awide variety ofexperiments inmagne-
tism.Thebook proved, however, tobe
toomuch inadvance of itstimeand
wassoon forgotten. Forthenexthun-
dred and fifty years there was little
progress, but inthe latter part ofthe
eighteenth century magnetism began to
berecognized astheexact science that it
hasbecome today.
V :2SOME PROPERTIES OFMAGNETS
When anironbar isstroked with a
natural magnet, theiron itself becomes
capable ofattracting other pieces ofiron
or steel. Ithasbecome an artificial
magnet (Fig. 22:1). Ifthismagnet
isbrought near toanumber ofdifferent
materials insuccession, itisfound that
only afew ofthese, called magnetic
substances, areattracted. Among these
areiron, nickel, cobalt andafewspecial
alloys. The materials which arenot
attracted aresaid tobenon-magnetic
(Chap. 31,Exp. 1).
259
Chap. 22 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
Ifabarmagnet isrolled iniron
filings, thefilings areseen tobeattracted
inlarge clumps around theends ofthe
magnet (Fig. 22:2). These points at
which themagnetic force isconcen-
trated arecalled thepoles ofthemag-
net(Chap. 31,Exp. 2).
Fig. 22:1 Artificial Magnets
(a)AHorseshoe Magnet.
(b)ABarMagnet.
Amagnet which issuspended freely
from anon-magnetic stand willalways
come torestwith itsaxisalong aline
running approximately north-south. The
same end ofthemagnet willalways
point towards thenorth. This isdesig-
nated thenorth-seeking (N-pole) oftheanother magnet, thepoles willbeob-
served tomove farther apart (Fig.

Magnetism.
22:3). This motion iscaused bya
force, hereoneofrepulsion. When the
S-pole ofthesuspended magnet is
approached byanN-pole ofanother
magnet they willbeattracted toeach
other. From such observations wemay
conclude that:
likemagnetic poles repel; unlike
magnetic poles attract.
This iscalled theLaw ofMagnetism
(Chap. 31,Exp. 4).

seeking pole (S-pole) (Chap. 31,Exp.

IftheN-pole ofthesuspended magnet
isnow approached bytheN-pole ofV:3THEEARTH ASAMAGNET
Intheprevious section itwasshown
that asuspended magnet always comes
torestalong anorth-south line.The
magnet behaves inthiswaybecause the
earth itself possesses amagnetic field as
ifitcontained ahuge barmagnet lying
nearly parallel toitsaxis (Fig. 22:4).
Why istheend ofthemagnet that
points north labelled 6'?
The magnetic north pole islocated
about 1400 miles south ofthegeographic
north pole intheextreme north-central
part ofCanada.

Themodern magnetic compass (Fig.

isfree tomove inahorizontal plane.
TheN-pole ofthecompass willpoint

always tothe earth’s magnetic north
pole.Theangle between thetruenorth
and thedirection inwhich thecompass
points iscalled theangle ofdeclination
(Fig. 22:6). Itisevident thattheangle
ofdeclination willvarywith position on
the earth’s surface. Anavigator must
determine itsvalue from charts inorder
tofind true north from thecompass
bearing athisposition. The declination
atToronto, Ontario, wasapproximately
7°west in1955. This indicates that the
angle between the linesdrawn from
Toronto tothegeographic north pole
and tothemagnetic north pole is7°,
andthemagnetic line iswest oftheline
tothegeographic pole. Themagnetic
north pole shifts itsposition slowly west-
ward, and itsexact location must bere-
surveyed frequently inorder tocorrect
charts fornavigation purposes.
V :4THEMAGNETIC FIELD
The effect ofamagnet isnoticeable
over aconsiderable space surrounding it.
This canbedemonstrated byplacing acompass-needle atanumber ofpositions
atvarying distances from themagnet
andobserving thedirection inwhich the
needle points. Thespace surrounding a
magnet inwhich itsmagnetic influence
canbedetected isknown asthemag-
netic field ofthemagnet.
Magnetic fields were studied byGil-
bert inthe sixteenth century, but
Michael Faraday (1791-1867) showed
that they could bebest described and
interpreted bymeans ofmagnetic maps
made upofaseries oflinesknown as
lines offorce.Aline offorcemay be
defined asthepath that would be
travelled byafreeN-pole ifatliberty to
move inamagnetic field. Byspecifying
themovement ofanN-pole inourde-
finition weobtain theconventional di-
rection forthelines offorce, i.e.,from
theN-pole ofthemagnet, which would
repel thefreeN-pole, totheS-pole of
themagnet which would attract it.
Aneffective method ofdemonstrating
thedisposition ofthelines offorce about
amagnet isdescribed inchapter 31,

262
MAGNETISM Sec.V:6
experiment 5.Some examples ofmagne-
ticmaps obtained inthisway areshown
inFig.22 :7.
The properties oflines offorce as
shown onthesemapsmaybesummarized
asfollows:
1.Lines offorce form closed curves,
leaving theN-pole ofthemagnet,
proceeding through space totheS-pole,
andcompleting their path through the
magnet. The apparently loose ends
shown inthediagrams are actually
parts ofcomplete lines linking thepoles
ofthemagnets.
2.Lines offorce never cross buttend
torepel each other, thus spreading
farther andfarther apart asthey leave
theN-pole ofthemagnet.
3.Lines offorce behave likestretched
elastic bands, tending tocontract and
thus toshorten their paths.
4.The concentration ofthe lines of
force determines thestrength ofthe
magnetic field atany point. Thus the
field isstrongest close tothepoles of
themagnet.
The property ofasubstance that
allows magnetic lines offorce topass
through itiscalled permeability. Sub-
stances such assoftironandpermalloy,
analloy ofnickel and iron,which allow
lines offorce topass through them
readily aresaid tohave ahighpermea-
bility. For thisreason these materials are
usedwhere astrong magnetic field is
desirable asintheelectromagnet (Sec.
V:50) and thegalvanometer (Sec.
V:53).
V ;5THEANGLE OFINCLINATION
InsectionV :3theearthwasdescribed
aspossessing amagnetic field ofitsown.
It isthehorizontal component ofthis
field that activates themagnetic com-
pass.Theexact direction ofthemagnetic
lines offorcemaybedetermined bythe
useofadipping needle. This consistsofamagnetized needle that isfree to
turn inavertical plane, andaprotractor
tomeasure itsinclination from thehori-
zontal (Fig. 22:8). The plane ofthis
needle must beadjusted sothat itis
parallel tothedirection indicated bya
compass. Theinstrument willthen indi-
cate thedirection ofthe lines offorce.
Atthemagnetic poles theneedle will

stand vertically and thereading on its
protractor will thus be90°. Atthe
magnetic equator theneedle will be
horizontal and theangle ofinclination
ordip willbe0°.Other locations on
the earth’s surface will give readings
between these extremes. AtToronto the
angle ofinclination isabout 74°.
V:6INDUCED MAGNETISM
Anunmagnetized piece ofsoft iron
willnotattract iron filings. If,however,
webring itnear thepole ofabarmag-
net,theiron willbecome amagnet and
exhibit powers ofattraction. When the
barmagnet isremoved thesoftiron will
lose itsmagnetic properties very rapidly.
Theiron issaid tohavebeenmagnetized
byinduction. IftheS-pole ofthebar
magnet approaches thesoftiron itcan

nearest themagnet becomes anN-pole
and the otlier endbecomes anS-pole
(Chap. 31,Exp. 6).
Ifabarofsoft iron isheld atthe
angle totheearth’s surface that isindi-
cated byadipping needle andoneend
istapped sharply with ahammer, itcan
bedemonstrated that theiron hasbe-
come aweak magnet (Chap. 31,Exp.
7).Thus weseethat even theweak

magnetic field oftheearth iscapable
ofcausing magnetism byinduction.
Itmay bereadily understood then,
that magnetic substances such asthe
iron parts ofmachines, steelframeworksofbuildings, hulls ofships, etc.may
become magnetized byinduction. The
magnetic fields from these structures
may seriously affect delicate measuring
instruments such aswatches andcom-
passes.
Inorder toprotect such instruments
they arefrequently enclosed inamag-
netic shield ofsome highly permeable
metal. The lines offorce passthrough
theshielding material more readily than
through thespace enclosed by it(Chap.
31,Exp. 8),and sotheinstruments
operate freefrom magnetic disturbance.
The effect ofmagnetic shielding is
illustrated inFig.22:9.
Induced magnetism plays animpor-
tant part inmany ofthedevices that
willbestudied inlater chapters ofthis
unit.
V:7ATHEORY OFMAGNETISM
Ifapiece ofironwiremagnetized as
inexperiment 9,chapter 31, issubjected
tocontinued division and sub-division,
each piece willbefound tobeasmall
magnet possessing anN-pole andan
S-pole (Chap. 31,Exp. 10).When
these pieces finally become toosmall for
further division, wemay imagine the
process tobecontinued until finally the
264
MAGNETISM Sec.V:7
molecule oftheiron isreached. Thus
each molecule would possess itsownN-
andS-pole ofequal strength. Wemay
then reason that allmagnetic substances
arecomposed ofmolecules that aretiny
magnets inthemselves (Chap. 31,E.xp.
11)-,
Using thistheory theunmagnetized

distribution ofmillions ofmolecular
magnets inthebar (Fig. 22:10a). The
haphazard arrangement ofN-and
S-poles neutralizes their effect andno
external magnetism isevident. When
thebar isstroked with theN-pole ofa
magnet the S-poles ofthemolecular
magnets areattracted inthedirection
ofthestroking magnet andthemolecules
become aligned asshown inFig.22:10b.
Attheend ofthebar lasttouched by
theN-pole ofthemagnet there willbe
many S-poles ofthemolecular magnets
andthus itwillactastheS-pole ofour
newmagnet. Theopposite end,having
many molecular N-poles willbethenew
N-pole. Inthecentral region ofthe
bartheN-andS-poles ofthemolecules
willagain neutralize each other sothatwecannowaccount fortheconcentra-
tion ofmagnetic properties atthepoles
ofthemagnet.
This molecular theory ofmagnetism
provides asimple explanation ofmany
magnetic phenomena. The fact that
there arethesame numbers ofunbal-
anced N-and S-poles ateither end of
amagnetized iron barmeans that the
poles ofabarmagnet willbeequally
strong. Asection taken across the
magnetized bar willexpose anequal
number ofN-andS-poles showing that
equal and opposite poles willbepro-
duced onbreaking themagnet. Satura-
tion effect, i.e.,amagnetic substance
canbemagnetized onlyuptoacertain
strength isclearly due tothefact that
when allmolecular magnets have been
drawn into linethere canbenofurther
increase inmagnetic strength. The loss
ofmagnetism due torough handling or
heat isdue tothedisturbance ofthe
molecules andareversion totherandom
arrangement.

CHAPTER 23 ELECTROSTATICS
V :9INTRODUCTION TO
ELECTROSTATICS
Every high-school student isfamiliar
withmany devices operated byelectri-
city. However, this iselectricity inmo-
tion, acomparatively recent scientific
development. Early experiments inthis
fieldwere confined toelectricity atrest,
orstatic electricity. The discovery of
electricity isgenerally attributed to
Thales ofMiletus, oneoftheseven wise
men ofGreece, about 600 b.c.He
learned thatamber, ayellowish fossil-
ized resin, when rubbed with afabric
would attract light objects. This knowl-
edge remained an isolated fact of
science forover twothousand years.
From thebeginning oftheseventeenth
century electrical science began togrow,
and itisfrom theearly experiments
ofsuchmen asGilbert andGray in
England, duFay inFrance, andFrank-
lininAmerica thatmany ofourfun-
damental concepts ofelectricity have
arisen. The study ofelectrostatics has
paved theway foradvancement incur-
rent electricity.
V:10ELECTRIC CHARGES
Asmentioned above, thephenomenon
ofelectric charges was firstnoted over2500 years ago. However, similar dis-
coveries have beenmade byeveryone
early inlife.What child hasnotbeen
fascinated todiscover thatonacolddry
daythecomb which hasjuststraightened
hishair willnow pickupbitsofpaper?
Who hasnotbeen startled byashock
after scuffing across acarpet totouch
another person orametallic object?
Materials which havegained theproperty
ofattracting small bitsofpaper andother
light objects aresaid tohaveanelectric
charge (Chap. 31,Exp. 12). Substances
thatdonothave thischarge aresaid to
beneutral. Since many non-magnetic
materials areattracted, itisevident that
electric charges differ from magnetism.
Ithasbeenfound bymany experiments
thatwhenever two different substances
arerubbed together each willbecome
electrically charged. It isthischarge
that builds upingasoline tank trucks
astheymove along thehighways. To
prevent sparking, which could cause an
explosion, achain drags behind thetruck
toallow thecharge toleak offgradually.
Responsibility formany fires hasbeen
traced tocharges ofstatic electricity and
precautions arenecessary inmany indus-
trial plants toensure thatsparking does
notoccur.

aretwo different kinds of electric
charges. In1750 Benjamin Franklinintroduced theterm negative todescribe
thecharge produced onanebonite rod
rubbed with furorwool, and positive
forthecharge onaglass rodrubbed
with silk.Asimple law ofelectrical
charges maynowbestated: likecharges
repel each other; unlike charges attract
each other.
V:12THEELECTRON THEORY
Our knowledge ofthe structure of
matter hasmade great progress since
theturn ofthecentuiy. Experimental
work beyond thescope ofthis texthas
ledtoaconcept oftheatom fardifferent
from that held until 1897. Until that
time theatom wasthought tobethe
smallest particle ofmatter. Since then
ourconcept ofthestructure oftheatom
hasbeen constantly changing. Forour
purposes itisconvenient tothink ofthe
atom asfollows:
1.Itmay bepictured asaminiature
solar system with acentral relatively
large mass, called thenucleus cor-
responding tooursun,andanum-
ber ofsmaller objects, called elec-
trons travelling intheir orbits about
thenucleus much astheplanets
move around thesun.
2.The nucleus iscomposed oftwo
kinds ofparticles:
(a)Protons—which are positively
charged andareconsidered to
have unitmass.
(b)Neutrons—which havenoelec-
triccharge andhave thesame
mass astheproton.
3.The electrons arenegatively charged
andareapproximately asheavy
asaproton.
4.Atoms are normally neutral in
charge. Therefore wemayconclude
that ineachatom there must beas
many electrons moving around the
nucleus asthere areprotons within
thenucleus.
269
Chap. 23 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY

Fig.23:2 Diagrams ofSeveral Atoms— Electrons (•),Protons(+),Neutrons (n).
5.There areoveronehundred differ-
entkinds ofatoms known atthe
present time. Scientists believe that
evenmore willbeidentified inthe
near future. Theatoms ofdifferent
elements differ from each other in
thenumbers ofprotons and neu-
trons contained inthenucleus and
inthenumber andarrangements of
electrons intheir orbits. Some typi-
caldiagrams ofatoms areshown
inFig.23:2.
Anunderstanding ofthis theory of
atomic structure enables ustoexplain
whyanobject becomes charged byfric-
tion.Tremendous forces arerequired to
separate aproton from thenucleus of
anatom. However, itisrelatively easy
tocause anelectron toleave anatom or
tomove toanother atom. When an
ebonite rod isrubbed with cat’s fur,
electrons aretransferred from thefurto
theebonite and therodbecomes nega-
tively charged. The fur,having lost
electrons, becomes positively charged.
Similarly, when aglass rod isrubbed
with silk, electrons aretransferred from
the glass tothe silk sothat the glass
becomes positive andthesilknegative.
Wemaynow define apositive charge
asadeficiency ofelectrons. Anegative
charge isasurplus ofelectrons. Aneu-
tralbody hasequal numbers ofprotons
and electrons.V:13 ELECTROSCOPES
Before proceeding further inour dis-
cussion ofelectrostatics itisconvenient
tostudy themeans bywhich electric
charges may bedetected and identified.
Instruments used for thispurpose are
called electroscopes.
(a)ThePithBallElectroscope
The simplest form ofelectroscope con-
sists oftwo balls ofdried elder pith,
each about the sizeofapea,suspended
sidebysidefrom aninsulated stand by
silkthreads (Fig. 23:3). When thepith
balls areapproached byanuncharged
object noattraction orrepulsion willbe
noted. When acharged ebonite rod is
touched tothepith balls, they willbe
270
ELECTROSTATICS Sec.V:13
seen tobeattracted, cling totherod
foramoment, and then beviolently
repelled from it.The pith balls have
become negatively charged and they
willspring apart due totherepulsion of
likecharges. The stronger thecharge,
thegreater istherepulsion. When the
charged pith balls arenowapproached
byanobject bearing thesame kind of
charge, they willberepelled from it.
Ifthecharge ontheobject isopposite
tothat placed onthepith balls, they
willbeattracted toit(Chap. 31,Exp.
14).
These observations may beexplained
readily byreference tothe electron
theory. The rod, being negatively
charged, hasanexcess ofelectrons. Be-
cause therod ischarged andthepith
balls are not, they areattracted to it.
Asthepith balls touch therodsome
electrons move from therod tothe
electroscope. Thus thepith ballsbecome
negatively charged andarerepelled. This
series ofevents isshown diagram-
matically inFig.23:4. Itisfrequently
convenient touseanelectroscope with
onlyonepith ball asshown forelectro-
static experiments.
Similarly, thepith ballmaybegiven
apositive charge bytouching itwith a
charged glass rod. Inthiscase theelec-
trons willbetransferred from thepithball totherodwhich, being positively
charged, hasadeficiency ofelectrons.
Thus, thepith ball,when charged by
contact, receives thesame charge asthe
charging object.
(b)TheGold-Leaf Electroscope
This instrument, shown inFig.23:5
ismuch more sensitive than that des-
cribed above. Itconsists ofapiece of
Fig.23:5 Gold-Leaf Electroscope.

atitsupper edge toabrass plate atthe
end ofabrass rod. This assembly is
enclosed inametal casewith glass win-
dows forobservation. The rod isin-
271
Chap. 23 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
sulated from the case byaring of
sulphur, wax, orrubber. The rodgen-
erally terminates attheupper end in
aknob orflatdisc toreceive thecharge.
Anegative charge ontheelectroscope
maybeobtained bytouching theknob
with anegatively charged rod(Chap.
31,Exp. 15). Electrons willbetrans-
ferred from thecharged rod.totheknob,
rod, plate and leaf oftheelectroscope.
The similar charge ontheplate and
leaf causes repulsion and the leaf
diverges. The extent ofthisdivergence
isanindication ofthestrength ofthe
charge. Iftheknob isnowapproached
byanobject bearing thesame kind of
charge asthatontheelectroscope, there
willbefurther divergence ofthegold-
leaf. If,however, theobject bears the
opposite charge, the leaf willbeseen
tofall.When touched byapositively
charged object, electrons will leave the
electroscope and itwillbeleftwith a
positive charge.
V :14CONDUCTORS AND
INSULATORS
Insome materials, mostly metals, the
orbital electrons are soloosely bound
that they will leave theatom readily.
Insome other substances theelectrons
aresotightly bound totheir nuclei that
theirmovement isslight. Materials in
which electrons canmove readily are
called conductors (Chap. 31,Exp. 16).
Conductors may besolids, liquids, or
gases, although liquids and gases con-
duct electricity inaslightly differentmanner (Sec. V:40, V:77). Substances
inwhich theelectrons cannotmove
readily are called insulators. Afew
common conductors and insulators are
tabulated below.
V :15INDUCED CHARGES
Two metal spheres, AandB(Fig.
23:6), supported oninsulated stands are
placed incontact sothat theyform a
single conductor. Ifanegatively charged
ebonite rod isnowbrought near toA
asdescribed inchapter 31,experiment
17,and thesurfaces ofthespheres are
examined forcharge bymeans ofa
charged electroscope andaproof plane
(asmall metal disc attheend ofan
insulating-handle used totransfer charges
toanelectroscope), itwillbefound
that thesurface ofAnear theebonite

again examined, nocharges will be
found. This isanexample ofelectro-
static induction. The charges discov-
eredonthespheres while thecharged
rodwas near areknown asinduced
charges. They aredue totherepulsion
ofelectrons from sphere A,which thus
becomes positively charged, tosphere B,
which thus acquired anegative charge.
Induced charges arepossible only with
conductors since there arenofree elec-
trons ininsulators toallow themove-
ment necessary. IfAandBaresepar-
ated while theebonite rod isstill in
position, peiTnanent charges willremain
onthespheres (positive onA,negative
onB).
Iftherod isnowremoved and
thespheres allowed totouch, itwillbe
found thatnocharge remains oneither
sphere. Wemay conclude then, that
induced charges areequal.
V:16 CHARGING BYINDUCTION
Approach, butdonottouch, theknob
ofagold-leaf electroscope with anega-
tively charged ebonite rod(Chap. 31,Exp. 18).The leaf diverges asshown
inFig.23:7 because electrons are re-
pelled totheplateand leaf.Keeping the
charged rodnear, touch theknob with
afinger, that is,“ground” it.The leaf
will fall aselectrons arerepelled from
itto“ground”. Next, remove your fin-
ger,and then thecharged rod.The
leaf willdiverge again. Theremaining
electrons aredistributed over the elec-
troscope which isleftwith adeficiency
ofelectrons andthusapositive charge.
Inorder togive theelectroscope a
negative charge theabove procedure
must befollowed using apositively
charged rod. Thismethod isillustrated
inFig. 23:8. Students areadvised to
draw thediagrams andmake theneces-
sary explanations bearing inmind that
“ground” acts asasource ofextra
electrons.

trons are repelled from the disc to

thedisc isleftwith adeficiency ofelec-
trons and apositive charge. These
changes areillustrated inFig. 23:9. It
will benoted that very little ofthe
charge isremoved from theebonite cake.
The disc, therefore, canbecharged re-
peatedly inthemanner described above
without recharging theebonite.
V:18 THEWIMSHURST MACHINE
This isawell-known laboratory ma-
chine forthecontinuous production of
electric charge byinductive separation
andwas firstmade byJames Wims-
hurst about 1878. Itconsists oftwo
circular ebonite orshellacked glass plates
mounted close together and geared
soastorotate inopposite directions
(Fig. 23:10). Ontheouter surface of
each plate near therim arefixed an
even number ofequally spaced thinmetal sectors which serve both asinduc-
torsand carriers. Wire brushes, supported
attheends oftwometal rodsplaced at
right angles tooneanother across each
plate, rubagainst thesectors asthey pass
towards collecting combs consisting ofa
number ofsharp metal teeth directed
towards thesectors onboth front and
back plates. These combs areplaced at
either endofthehorizontal diameter of
theplates andeach isconnected toa
discharging knob supported above the
machine.
The action ofthismachine isbeyond
thescope ofthis text. Interested stu-
dents areadvised torefer toagood
encyclopedia. Itisinteresting tonote
thatwith a1cm. airgap, 30,000 volts
arerequired tocause aspark discharge

high voltage there islittle danger from
thedischarge because ofthesmall quan-
tityofelectricity involved.

V:19DISTRIBUTION OFCHARGES
The location ofcharges onacharged
bodymay bedemonstrated asinchap-
ter 31,experiment 19A, using Biot's
Spheres shown inFig.23:11. The ap-
paratus consists ofaninsulated metal
sphere over which two tightly-fitting
insulated metal hemispheres can be
placed tocover itcompletely. Acharge
isgiven tothesphere and then the
hemispheres are fitted tightly over it.
When thehemispheres areremoved and
tested using aproof plane and electro-
scope, each willbefound topossess a
charge, while thesphere isfound to
have lost itscharge. The charge, then,
must have passed tothehemispheres as
they formed theouter surface ofthe
sphere. Charges reside onlyontheouter
surface ofacharged conductor.
Todetermine how thecharge isdis-
tributed over thesurface ofacharged
conductor wecancharge several insu-
lated conductors ofdifferent shapes as
described inchapter 31,experiment 19B.
Oninvestigation with aproof plane and
electroscope thefollowing observations
aremade:1.Inconductor (a)theleaves ofthe
electroscope show thesame diver-
gence nomatter what part is
touched bytheproof plane.
2.Inconductor (b) thedivergence
proves tobealittle greater from
tests attheends than atthecentre.
3.Inconductor (c)thedivergence is
much greater from tests atthemore
pointed parts oftheconductor than
elsewhere.
From these testswemayconclude that
thecharge onaconductor tends tobe
concentrated atthemore pointed parts
ofthesurface.
V :20LIGHTNING-RODS
About themiddle oftheeighteenth
century Benjamin Franklin demonstrated
inhis classic kite experiment that
thunder-clouds carry electrical charges
and that lightning isanelectrical dis-
charge orspark between clouds, or
clouds andobjects ontheearth.

Franklin made useofthisaction of

toprotect buildings against thedangers

ning occurs with itsaccompanying
thunder, ashock-wave, caused bythe
sudden and violent expansion oftheair
heated bythedischarge. The rods are
sodesigned that theinduced charge
escapes from thesharp points and soan
accumulation ofcharge isprevented. If
thelightning does strike therods, agood
conductor leads theelectricity safely to
ground through ametal rod deeply
buried inthedamp ground near the
building (Fig. 23:13).

CHAPTER 24 ELECTRIC CURRENT
V:22 INTRODUCTION
Inchapter 23 itwasshown that elec-
trons moved between theterminals of
theWimshurst machine and that light-
ning isactually amovement ofelectrons
between earthandcharged clouds. Such
movement ofelectrons iscalled anelec-
triccurrent.
Intheeighteenth century Luigi Gal-
vani, anItalian physiologist, discovered
thatafreshly dissected frog’s legshow-
edviolent muscular contractions when
touched bytwo dissimilar metals. He
erroneously attributed thisproperty to
thefrog,and itremained forAlessandro
Volta, anItalian professor ofphysics,
todemonstrate ashort time later that the
frog’s leghadacted only asasensitive
detector ofelectricity which hadbeen
produced bycontact with thedissimilar
metals. Volta showed that thiselectricity
was identical with that produced by
frictional means (Sec.V:10). From this
beginning heconstructed the firstsource
ofcontinuous electric current, thevoltaic
cell (Sec.V:23).
From the time ofpublication of
Volta’s works in1800, there hasbeen
continuous progress inthe field ofelec-
tricity. The sections that follow willhelp togiveyouanunderstanding ofthe
fundamentals ofelectricity thatmean so
much inourmodern way oflife.
V:23 THEVOLTAIC CELL
Every high-school student isfamiliar
with thetinydry cell that isused to
operate aflashlight andthelarger stor-
agebattery used tostart acar; these are
justtwomodern forms ofthevoltaic
cell.Avoltaic cell consists oftwo dis-
similar materials immersed inasolution
ofanacid, base, or salt, called the
electrolyte.
The simplest form ofvoltaic cell
consists ofacopper plate and azinc
plate placed inavessel containing dilute
sulphuric acid (Chap. 31,Exp. 21).
Asaresult ofthechemical action in
the cellthecopper plate becomes posi-
tively charged and the zinc plate
negatively charged. Ifthe plates are

then connected byaconductor (Fig.
24:1) thepotential difference between
them willcause electrons toflowfrom
thezinc tothecopper. The circuit is
completed through the electrolyte. As
thecurrent flows, hydrogen isdeposited
onthecopper plate and zinc sulphate
dissolves inthe electrolyte asthezinc
isgradually used up.The potential dif-
ference between the plates isapproxi-
mately 1.1volts. This P.D. isindepen-
dent ofthe sizeoftheplates used, but
varies with thematerials used. Inall
such cellschemical energy istransformed
into electrical energy.
V :24DEFECTS OFTHEVOLTAIC CELL
1.Polarization
Ifasmall flashlight bulb isconnected
inthe circuit ofavoltaic cell itwill
glow brightly forashort timeandthen
fade gradually until nolight isseen
(Chap 31,Exp. 21). Itisapparent that
thecurrent delivered bythe cellhas
decreased. This effect iscaused bypo-larization, which istheaccumulation of
bubbles ofhydrogen onthe positive
plate. The hydrogen deters theacid
from reaching theplateandserves asan
insulator preventing further transfer of
electrons. Torestore apolarized cellthe
bubbles may beremoved mechanically
bywiping the positive plate, shaking
it,or,chemically, byadding anoxidizing
agent such aspotassium dichromate to
the solution. Such achemical releases
oxygen which unites with thehydrogen
toform water. Substances added for
this purpose are called depolarizing
agents.
2.Local Action
Ifimpure orcommercial zinc isused
inthe cell, the plates arefound to
deteriorate rapidly evenwhen the cell is
notinuse.This iscaused bysmall par-
ticles ofsuch impurities aslead, iron,
carbon, etc.,occurring intheplates used.
Many small voltaic cells are setupbe-
tween these impurities and the zinc,
and local action continues until theplate

delivering nouseful current outside the
cell.
The useofpure zinc, ofcourse, would
beasimple remedy, butpure zinc is
expensive. Amore practical method of
eliminating local action istoamalgamate
thesurface ofthezinc plate withmer-
cury. The zinc dissolves intliemercury
andgradually comes tothesurface where
itreacts with theacid.The impurities
arecovered bythemercury and their
contact with theelectrolyte isprevented.
V:25 THEDRY CELL
Obviously, thevoltaic celldescribed
insectionV :23has several disadvan-
tages inpractical use.The dry cell
eliminates many ofthese undesirable
features. Itsstructure isshown inFig.

Asthe cell isused thezincbecomesthinner andmay eventually break open
allowing thepaste todryout. Tliis in-
creases theinternal resistance ofthe cell
tosuch anextent that little, ifany,
current willflow inthecircuit.
The potential difTerence ofafresh dry
cell isapproximately 1.5volts regardless
ofsize.Large dry cells areable topro-
duce current over longer periods than
smaller cells. Dry cells ofvarious sizes
andshapes havebeenmade tofillmany
needs. They arewidely used forflash-
lights, portable radios, telephones, hear-
ing aids, lanterns, andmany other
devices used bythearmed forces and
industry.

tialdifference ismeasured in
volts. The pressure difference
ismaintained bytheuseofbat-
teries orcellswhich provide a
source ofelectrons bymeans of
thetransformation ofchemical
energy. This potential differ-
ence istheelectromotive force

trons through thewire. Re-
sistance inthecircuit causes a
lowering ofpotential differ-
ence between points inthe
conductor. This isreferred to
asavoltage drop.
The units ofelectricity incommon useand their symbols aresum-
marized below forconvenient reference:
(a)Quantity ofelectricity (Q)—-unit isthecoulomb
(b)Current ofelectricity (/)—unit istheampere
(c)Potential difference {V )—unit isthevolt
(d)Resistance (R)—unit istheohm
Smaller orlarger units areobtained byusing submultiples ormultiples of
these as:

V :27ELECTRIC CURRENT AND
ELECTRON FLOW
Electric current hasbeen defined as
theflow ofelectrons through thewires
ofacircuit (Sec. V:26). From thebe-
ginning ofelectrical theory, thecurrent
hasbeen considered toflow, as isthe
casewith water, from theplace ofhigh
potential totheplace oflower potential.
Early scientists considered the positive
side ofasource ofelectricity tobeat1microvolt =1/1,000,000 volt
1microhm =1/1,000,000 ohm
1kilovolt =1,000 volts=1,000,000 ohms
etc.
ahigher potential than thenegative side.
Thus, theconvention that electric cur-
rent flows from positive tonegative came
intocommon use.
Wenowknow that thenegative side
ofasource hasasurplus ofelectrons
and the positive side adeficiency of
electrons (Sec. V:12). Following a
fundamental law ofnature, electrons
move from where there aremore to
where there arefewer. Electrons, there-
282
ELECTRIC CURRENT Sec.V:29
fore, actually move from negative to
positive.
Inallwork onelectronics, including
radio, itisnecessary torefer toelectron
movement inorder tounderstand the
operation ofmodern devices. However,
inmost other electrical work, unless
definitely specified, references have been
confined inthepast totheconventional
current flow, i.e.,positive tonegative. In
mostmodern writings, including thistext,
allreferences are totheelectron flow.
Nodifficulty need arise ifthedifference
between current flowand electron flow
isrecognized.
V :28TYPES OFCIRCUITS
Twomain types ofconnection arein
common useinelectric circuits and all
others aremerely combinations ofthese.
(a)Series Circuit
Inthisarrangement thecurrent goes
from oneterminal ofthesource toone
terminal ofthe firstappliance. Onpass-
ingthrough this, itflows tothenextand
thenext until itreaches theother ter-
minal ofthesource (Fig. 24:3). All
the current must pass through each
appliance, causing avoltage drop (Sec.
V:26) inthe circuit. Abreak inany
part ofthecircuit willstop allflow of
current. Series circuits arefrequently
found inChristmas-tree lights, butare
seldom used forother purposes.(b)Parallel Circuit
Intheparallel orshunt type ofcon-
nection theconductor from thepositive
terminal ofthesource isconnected to
oneterminal ofeach appliance and the
negative terminal ofthesource iscon-
nected totheother terminal ofeach

appliance (Fig. 24:4). This istypical of
wiring circuits used inyourhome. Each
appliance receives current independently
from theothers andthusabreak inone

the rest.

thirty dry cellsconnected inseries (Fig.

(b)Parallel
Iftheresistance inacircuit islow
and alarge current istobeused, dry
cells areconnected inparallel. Allthe
positive and negative terminals areerally ofthetypeshown inFig.24:7a.
Wall switches aresmaller variations of
thesame type.

P.D. ofsuch abattery remains thesame
asthat ofasingle cell. Since thecurrent
isprovided equally byallcells theparal-
lelarrangement gives alarge current for
arelatively long period oftime.
V :30SWITCHES
Just astapsareinserted inapipe line
tostop theflow ofwater, soswitches are
used tointerrupt theflow ofelectric
current inacircuit. These aredevices
which break orcomplete theconducting
path. Many types ofswitches are in
common use,butonlytwo willbede-
scribed here.
(a)Knife Switch
Modifications ofthecommon knife
switch areused tocontrol many house-
hold circuits. Themain switch isgen-circuits inwhich thecurrent isrequired
forshort intervals only. Electric door-
bells, signal buzzers, etc.make use of
thistype ofswitch.
Many newer types ofswitches have
been devised forspecific purposes, but
thescope ofthis text does notallow
their description at this time. The
interested student will find information
onmercury switches, automatic circuit
breakers, and special switching arrange-
ments such asthose used tocontrol a
stairway light from either upstairs or

The relationship between current

>f:34 FACTORS AFFECTING
RESISTANCE
The resistance ofaconductor depends
onfourmain factors;
(a)Length—The resistance ofacon-
ductor varies directly as itslength
i.e.,twice thelength gives twice the
resistance; half thelength gives half
theresistance; etc.
(b)Cross-section —The resistance of
aconductor varies inversely asthe
area of itscross-section i.e., twice
thecross-sectional area gives half the
resistance; half the cross-sectional
area gives twice theresistance; etc.
(c)Temperature —Inmost metals an
increase intemperature causes anin-
crease inresistance, but insomesubstances such asglass, carbon and
electrolytes anincrease intemperature
causes adecrease inresistance.
(d)Material—Materials differ widely
intheir resistances. Good conductors
such ascopper andaluminum have
very low resistances. Poor conduc-
torssuch asnichrome andmanganin
havemuch higher resistances. Good
insulators, such asglass, mica, etc.,
have veryhigh resistances.

The potential difference which causes

readily calculated byusingOhm’s Law.

the reciprocal ofthe total resistance
equals thesum ofthereciprocals ofthe
individual resistances.

Resistors areused primarily tocontrol
current andpotential difference inelec-
tric circuits. They areconstructed in
many forms and sizesvarying from those
which have resistances ofonly afraction
ofanohm, asused insome measuring
instruments, tothose having resistances
ofmany megohms asfound inradio
receivers. Ingeneral, however, resistors
may be classified aseither fixed or
variable.
(a)Fixed Resistors
These may beconstructed ofshort
lengths ofmetal strip forvery low re-
sistances. Carbon orwire coils willpro-
videhigher resistances. Carbon resistors
arefrequently used inradios andother
equipment inwhich some variation in
resistance ispermissible since such re-
sistors may have anerror tolerance of
upto20%. Wire-wound resistors mayconstantan ormanganin (alloys ofcop-
perand nickel), having anaccuracy
within 1%.These are ingeneral use
for laboratory work and measuring-
instruments.

through theblocks when theshorting-
plugs areplaced inposition. Pulling
outtheplug puts the resistor below it
into the circuit. Such aboxprovides a
large range ofstandardized resistors for
laboratory use.Toavoid errors inusing

inserted firmly. Plugs and sockets must
bekeptclean atalltimes.

Variable resistors such asthis are of
various sizesand shapes and areused
inradio volume controls, fordimmer

CHAPTER 26 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF
ELECTRIC CURRENT
V :40ELECTROLYSIS
Allchemical compounds arecomposed
oftwoormore elements. Theelements
arecomposed ofatoms asdescribed in
Section V:12. Frequently when atoms
unite, electrons aretransferred fromone
kind ofatom totheother. Theatoms
which lose electrons become charged
positively and the others negatively.
These charged particles arecalled ions.
Theoppositely charged ionsattract each
other toform ion-pairs. However, the
totalnumber ofpositive and negative
charges hasnotbeen altered, sothat
theion-pairs formed areneutral. When
substances formed inthisway are dis-
solved inwater, some ofthese particles
dissociate into separate positive and
negative ions.Compounds which form
ions insolution arecapable ofcarrying
electric current andarecalled electro-
lytes. Examples ofgood electrolytes are
solutions ofacids bases and salts.Many
other substances donotionize when in
solution and sodonotconduct elec-
tricity. These areclassed asnon-electro-
lytes. Sugar, alcohol and distilled water
areexamples ofthese. Ordinary water
usually contains dissolved salts which
make itaweak electrolyte. Itisforthisreason that onecan receive asevere
electric shock while standing inwater
oronadamp floor.
Shortly after thediscovery ofcurrent
electricity byGalvani andtheconstruc-
tion ofthe first voltaic cells, experimen-
ters likeSirHumphrey Davy ofEngland
andSvante Arrhenius ofSweden investi-
gated thedecomposition ofwater by
electricity, oraswespeak ofitnow, the
electrolysis ofwater. Davy showed that
inthedecomposition ofwater, the
volume ofhydrogen produced isdouble
that ofoxygen. Hismost striking dis-
coveries were thebreaking apart by
electricity ofthealkalis, caustic sodaand
caustic potash. Arrhenius explained these
phenomena byhistheory ofionization
which assumes that insolutions ofelec-
trolytes there isatleast apartial dis-
sociation ofthedissolved substances into
separate ions. Itwasnotuntil 1834 that
Faraday introduced thetermanode for
thepositive plate andcathode forthe
negative plate inanelectrolytic cell
(Fig. 26:1). Thenegatively charged ions
which areattracted totheanode be-
came known asanions, and the posi-
tively charged ionswhich areattracted
tothecathode ascations. When com-
pounds dissociate insolution, metals and
hydrogen form cations while non-metals
and most chemical radicals become
anions.
Atypical electrolytic cell consists of
twoconducting-plates orelectrodes im-
mersed inanelectrolyte. Theanode is
295
Chap. 26 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
connected tothepositive terminal ofa
battery orgenerator andbecomes posi-
tively charged while thecathode iscon-
nected tothenegative terminal and
becomes negatively charged. Anions will
move totheanode where they giveup
their surplus electrons, areneutralized,
and released asneutral atoms. These
electrons flowfrom theanode, through
theconnecting wire tothebattery ter-
minal. Atthesame time cations move
tothecathode where they receive elec-
trons andbecame neutral atoms. Elec-
tronsmove from thenegative battery
terminal tothecathode toreplenish the

supply. Thuswehave electrons moving
from thenegative battery terminal to
thecathode, through theelectrolyte by
way oftheions totheanode, andbacktothepositive terminal ofthebattery.
The electrolyte isdecomposed bythe
electric current. This process isknown
aselectrolysis.
V :41ELECTROLYSIS OFWATER
Water may bedecomposed readily in
asimple electrolytic cell (Fig. 26:1), or
intheHoflFman water voltameter (Fig.
26:2), bythepassage ofadirect cur-
rent through it(Chap. 31,Exp. 25).

Asmallamount ofsulphuric acid(about
10% ofthe total volume) isadded to
thewater tomake itabetter electrolyte.
Theanode andcathode aremade of
platinum which isunaffected bythe
electrolyte and isagood conductor of
electricity.
Insolution theacid ishighly dis-

V:43 LAWS OFELECTROLYSIS
From your experimental work on
electrolysis itwillbeapparent that there
isaclose connection between thecurrent
strength usedandtheamount ofmater-
ialthat isdecomposed (Chap. 31,Exp.
27). Itwill also bereadily noted in
theprevious examples that thegreater
thetime that thecurrent flows, the
greater theamounts ofwater decomposed
orcopper deposited. Further, itisnot
difficult toshow thatagreater mass of
silver than ofcopper willbedeposited
using thesame current forthesame
length oftime. These observations were
made aslongago as1834 byFaraday
whoformulated Faraday’s Laws ofElec-
trolysis asfollows:
1.Theamount ofchemical change pro-
duced (i.e., theamount ofany sub-stance deposited) byanelectric cur-
rent isproportional tothequantity of
electricity passed (Quantity =Current
XTime.)
2.Theamounts ofdifferent substances
deposited bythesame quantity ofelec-
tricity areproportional totheir equiva-
lent weights. (The equivalent weight
ofasubstance istheweight ofthesub-
stance deposited by96,400 coulombs.)
Thenumber ofgrams ofvarious ele-
ments liberated byoneampere inone

V;44THECOPPER VOLTAMETER
The internationally accepted definition
oftheampere isbased onthedeposition
ofmetal atthecathode ofanelectrolytic
cellorvoltameter. Silver wasselected as
thestandard, since therelatively large
amount ofsilver deposited inashort
timeenables agreater degree ofaccuracy
inweighing, andbecause silver isvery
resistant tooxidation. The international
ampere isdefined asthatcurrent which,
when passed through asolution ofsilver
nitrate inaccordance with given specifi-
cations, deposits silver atthe rate of
0.001118 gm.persecond.
While silver isthebestsubstance for
accurate results, acopper voltameter is
satisfactory for determining current

V:45 ELECTROPLATING
Electroplating isanimportant indus-
trial process designed toimprove the
appearance, orincrease resistance to
corrosion, ofvarious metals. Itconsists
ofcovering themetal with athin layer
ofsilver, chromium, copper, etc., by
electrolysis. The article tobeplated
serves asthecathode andasolution of
acompound ofthemetal tobedeposited
makes uptheelectrolyte (Chap. 31,Exp.
29). Before plating, theobject must be
thoroughly cleaned ofrust, grease, etc.
This isusually accomplished bytreat-
ment with abrasives followed byrinsing
instrong acid, then strong alkali, then
weak acid again, and finally distilled
water. Inorder toobtain afine long-
lasting deposit asmall current over a
longtime interval must beused.Special platings require modifications
intheprocess. Forexample, silver plat-
ing isusually preceded bycopper plating
togiveasuitable base. Incopper plating
better results areobtained ifalittle sul-
phuric acid isadded totheelectrolyte.
Chromium plating directly onanother
metal leaves small openings likepin-holes
inthesurface sothat corrosion may
begin below thechromium layer. To
avoid thisthebasemetal isoften lightly
coated with nickel before thechromium
isapplied.
Electroplating hasalsobeen applied to
theprinting industry inthereproduction
ofpages oftypeand illustrations, apro-
cess called electrotyping. Animpression

V:46 THELEAD-ACID STORAGE
BATTERY
When thesimple voltaic cell (Sec.
V;23), and thedry cell (Sec. V:25),
become discharged theymust bedis-
carded andreplaced bynew cells. Cells
ofthistype are classified asprimary
cells.The lead storage celldiffers from
these inthatonce itschemical energyhasbeen exhausted, thecellmaybere-
stored toitsoriginal condition byelec-
trical means. Such cells are called
secondary cells.The familiar lead-acid
storage battery used inthe electrical
system ofmany automobiles consists of
sixsecondary cells connected inseries
toprovide approximately 12 volts.
Chemical energy isstored intheactive
materials oftheplates and intheelec-
trolyte when current ispassed through
during charging. This chemical energy
istransformed into electrical energy as
the cells aredischarged inproviding
current inacircuit (Chap. 31,Exp. 30).

(b)Discharging theCell
Asthe cell isused toprovide theE.M.F. which causes current to
flow inacircuit, itbecomes discharged. The sulphuric acidcombines
with theporous materials ofthe plates and thefollowing chemical
reaction occurs:
negative positive diluted
plates plates electrolyte both plates electrolyte
lead+lead peroxide +sulphuric acid-»lead sulphate +water
Asthetwo plates become coated with thesame material thepotential
difference decreases. Simultaneously, theremoval ofsulphuric acidfrom
theelectrolyte and theformation ofwater causes dilution oftheacid
inthe cell. Thus, discharged cells areindicated byalowering ofthe
P.D. ofthe cellandadecrease inthespecific gravity oftheelectrolyte.
Afully charged cellshould have aP.D. ofapproximately 2.2volts, andfrom touching the positive plates by
wood separators. The plates arecon-

specific gravity falls to1.185.
(c)Recharging theCell
Inorder torecharge the celldirect current from arectifier orsome
other source must bepassed through the cellinthedirection opposite

Thus, theplates areagain made dissimilar andtheP.D. increases to

produced bythe reaction, sothe specific gravity ofthe electrolyte
increases.
Thecharging anddischarging reactions may besummarized as:

observed that awire carrying anelec-

Further experiments established that

ofsuch currents.
The simplest form ofthistype ofgal-
vanometer isshown inFig. 27:18. It
consists ofapermanent horseshoe magnet
andacoilofwirewhich isfree toswing
between the poles ofthemagnet. A
stationary softiron core ismounted in-
side the coil toconcentrate the lines of
force. Springs attached tothecoilserve
toconduct theelectrons intoandoutof
the coiland also tobring the coil to
rest inaposition where theplane of
the coil faces away from thepoles of
themagnet, asshown inthediagram. As
current passes through the coil itwill
turn, sothat theN-pole ofthe coil is
toward theS-pole ofthemagnet, and
theS-pole ofthe coil istoward the
N-pole ofthemagnet (Sec.V:52). This
movement isrestricted bythe springs.
Theamount ofturning isindicated by
theattached pointer moving across a
calibrated scale. The stronger theelec-
triccurrent through the coil, thegreater
themagnetic fieldproduced, and sothehigher thereading onthe scale. This
moving-coil type ofmeter isthe basis
ofmost standard electrical measuring
instruments incommon use.
V :54AMMETERS ANDVOLTMETERS
Ammeters and voltmeters areinstru-
ments designed tomeasure electric cur-
rentandpotential difference respectively.
They are essentially galvanometers of
themoving-coil type (Sec.V:53), modi-
fiedbytheaddition ofsuitable resis-
tances. Their scales arecalibrated to
read directly inamperes orvolts.
(a)Ammeters
Thewirewinding onthemoving coil
ofanammeter must bevery fineand
light toallow thenecessary freedom of
movement. Such aconductor cannot
carry alarge current without undue
heating (Sec. V:71), and consequent
melting ofthewire. Themovable coil
ofsuchaninstrument israrely allowed
tocarry more than 0.05amperes.

rentmust bedivided sothatnomore
than 0.05 amperes will flow through
themoving coil,and the rest ofthe
current willbecarried around the coil

with theinstrument (Fig. 27:19). Such
ashunt must have averylowresistance

theammeter must beconnected inseries.Asaresult, allthecurrent, oraknown
fraction ofthe total current, will pass
through theinstrument coil. Inorder
toavoid affecting thetotal current inthe
circuit, the resistance oftheammeter
must bevery low. Iftheammeter were
accidentally connected across thecircuit,
ahigh current would flow through it
and theinstrument would be“burned
out”.Toavoid thisafuse (Sec.V:72)
should beconnected inseries with the
ammeter.

deflection with acurrent of0.05amperes. What value ofshunt resistance
must beused toconvert ittoanammeter reading upto5amperes?
Current tobecarried byammeter=5amp.

(b)Voltmeters
Since avoltmeter isused tomeasure
the potential difference between two
points inacircuit, itmust beconnected
inparallel with the circuit between
these points. Therefore, avoltmeter must
have avery high resistance toavoiddrawing alarge current. Asaresult
thetotal current inthecircuit willnot

may beconverted toavoltmeter bythe
addition ofahigh resistance inseries
with themoving coil (Fig. 27:20).

V:55 THEELECTRIC MOTOR
The electric motor isstudied inex-
periment 35,chapter 31,using aSt.
Louis motor (Fig. 27:21). Inorder to
understand itsoperation consider an
electromagnet mounted onanaxis so
that itisfree torotate between thepoles
ofamagnet (Fig. 27:22). Ifacurrent
ispassed through theelectromagnet so
astoproduce anS-pole atthetop, asshown, theS-pole willbeattracted by
theN-pole ofthestationary field. Simi-
larly theN-pole oftheelectromagnet
willbeattracted bytheS-pole ofthe
stationary magnet. These forces cause
theelectromagnet, which serves asthe
motor armature, torotate. Themomen-
tum ofthisarmature causes ittorotate
sothattheS-pole ofthearmature passes
slightly beyond theN-pole ofthemagnet.

through physics and chemistry.
V:58 CAUSE OFANINDUCED
CURRENT
Itisasimple matter todemonstrate,
asFaraday did, that, just aselectrons in
motion can setupamagnetic field, a
magnetic field inmotion cancause a
flow ofelectrons. Three such experi-
ments aredescribed inchapter 31,ex-
periment 36.
Ifagalvanometer isconnected tothe
terminals ofasolenoid andabarmagnet
oranelectromagnet isheld above the
solenoid (Fig. 28:2), nocurrent is
obtained. When themagnet isthrust
into thecentre ofthe coil, i.e., the
strength ofthemagnetic field isincreas-
ed,thegalvanometer needle ismomen-
tarily deflected from itscentre position.
Thegalvanometer needle returns tothe
zero position when themagnet remains
stationary inthesolenoid, i.e.,while the
strength ofthemagnetic field remains
constant. When themagnet iswithdrawn
quickly from thesolenoid, thestrength
ofthemagnetic field decreases, and the
galvanometer needle isagain deflected,
but thistime intheopposite direction.
Itisapparent, then, thataflow ofelec-
trons originated each time themagnet
wasmoved. This iscalled induced cur-
rent,andtheeffect caused bythechang-
ingmagnetic fieldaround aconductor
iscalled electromagnetic induction.Foraninduced current toflow inthe
circuit there must, ofcourse, beanelec-
tromotive force inthe circuit (Sec.
V:26). This induced E.M.F. iscaused
bythechanging magnetic fieldabout the
conductor.
Similarly, inthecircuit usedbyFara-
day (Fig. 28:1), when theswitch in
circuit containing thebattery and the
primary coil(C)wasopened, theelec-
tron flowwasstopped. Thus, themag-
netic field about theprimary coil de-
creased rapidly tozero. This changing
magnetic field cut the turns ofthe
secondary coil (5') inthe circuit and
anE.M.F. wasinduced. When theswitch
wasclosed, current flowed intheprimary
circuit andasthemagnetic fieldincreased
from zero toamaximum, anE.M.F.
wasinduced again inthesecondary
circuit, causing acurrent toflow inthe
opposite direction.
From these experiments wemay con-
clude thataninduced E.M.F. iscaused
bythechanging magnetic field about
theconductor.
V:59 MAGNITUDE OFINDUCED
E.M.F.
Inexperiment 37,chapter 31, itwill
beobserved that, ifthemagnet isslowly
plunged intoandwithdrawn from the
solenoid, there willbeslight deflection
ofthegalvanometer needle. Iftheaction
isrepeated more andmore rapidly, it
willbeseen that theamount ofdeflec-
tion isdirectly proportional tothespeed
ofmovement ofthemagnet. Thus, we
may conclude that thestrength ofthe
induced current isproportional tothe
speed atwhich themagnet ismoved or
theE.M.F. induced inacircuit ispro-
portional totherate ofchange ofthe
magnetic field cutting theconductor.
Ifamagnet isthrust first intoacoil
offew turns and then, atthesame
speed, into acoil ofmany turns, and
thedeflection ofagalvanometer inthe
318
ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION Sec.V:60
circuit isnoted, itwillbefound that a
stronger induced current flows inthe
coilhaving thelarger number ofturns.
Therefore, itisevident that theE.M.F.
induced inacircuit isproportional to
thenumber ofturns oftheconductor
cutbythevarying magnetic field.
When apowerful electromagnet with
aniron core issubstituted forthebar
magnet intheexperiment described
above itwillbeobserved that, with the
rate ofmovement and thenumber of
turns inthe coilremaining constant,
thedeflection ofthegalvanometer needle
isgreatly increased. Itisapparent, then,
that theE.M.F. induced inacircuit is
proportional tothe strength ofthe
changing magnetic field.
V:60 DIRECTION OFANINDUCED
CURRENT
The direction ofaninduced current
isstudied inexperiment 38,chapter 31.
Here, the direction ofthecurrent is
notedwhen (a)theN-pole ofamagnet
isthrust into thecoil; (b)theN-pole is

withdrawn; (c)theS-pole isinserted;
(d)theS-pole iswithdrawn. AstheN-
pole enters thesolenoid (Fig. 28:2) a
current isinduced which produces anN-pole attheend ofthesolenoid where
themagnet enters. ThisN-pole repels the
N-pole ofthemagnet andopposes the
motion ofthemagnet. AstheN-pole of

themagnet iswithdrawn from the coil
(Fig. 28:3) theinduced current isin
such adirection astoproduce anS-pole
atthesame end ofthesolenoid. The
attraction ofthisS-pole ofthesolenoid
fortheN-pole ofthemagnet tends to
oppose thewithdrawal ofthemagnet.
Similar results may befound when the
electromagnet isused. These eflfects are
summarized inLenz’sLawwhich states:
The direction ofaninduced current is
such that themagnetic fieldwhich it
produces opposes themotion orchange
that induces thecurrent.
Because oftheir importance, primary
andsecondary currents require special
treatment. Itwasnoted (Sec. V:58),
thatsecondary currents areinopposite
directions when theprimary isopened
compared towhen itisclosed. Itis
demonstrable that theprimary and
secondary currents areinthesame direc-
tionwhen theprimary circuit isopened
(atthe“break”) and intheopposite
direction when it isclosed (atthe
“make”). The idea ofopposing mag-
319
Chap. 28 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
netic fields iscarried outhere inthat
theinduced current, while flowing inthe
same direction astheprimary, attempts
tomaintain themagnetic field that is
collapsing. Similarly, atthecompletion
oftheprimary circuit, theinduced cur-
rent isattempting tooppose amagnetic
fieldwhich isbeing built up. Itisfur-
thertobenoted that theinduced E.M.F.
isgreater atthe“break” because the
induced current tends tostrengthen the
field offorce oftheprimary.
V:61 THEEARTH INDUCTOR
The earth inductor isacoilwith a
diameter ofabout 18in.,made ofseveral
hundred turns offine insulated copper
wire.When thetwoend leads ofthe
coil areconnected toagalvanometer
and theinductor israpidly rotated
through 360°, thegalvanometer needle
willbeseen toswing first toone side
andthen totheother (Chap. 31,Exp.
39A). This action continues aslong as
theinductor isrotated.
InFig.28:4, asthecoilrotates clock-
wise,Adownward andBupward, little
cutting ofthelines offorce occurs anda

the first,much cutting ofthelines offorce
occurs, andtheE.M.F. produced willbe
larger. Throughout this90° ofrotation
theinduced E.M.F. hasbeen builtup
from zero. Itwillbeobvious that the
E.M.F. willgradually decrease tozero
inthenext 90°.Throughout thisrota-
tion of180°, theE.M.F. hasgonefrom

again (Fig. 28:5). The direction ofthe

V:62 THEALTERNATING-CURRENT
GENERATOR
Asindicated insection V:61, mech-
anical energy may beused toproduce
electrical energy. Adevice used forthis
purpose iscalled agenerator ordynamo.
Asimple generator (Fig. 28:6) con-
sists ofacoilofwire called anarma-
turewhich ismade torotate between
thepoles ofamagnet (Chap. 31,Exp.39B). To facilitate connections tothe
rotating armature, slip rings {Ai,A2)
areconnected toeach end ofthe coil
and rotate with it.Contact ismade by
metal orcarbon brushes {Bi,B2)which
connect thecoilwith theexternal circuit
containing thelamp (L).
Asthe coil rotates inthedirection
shown inthediagram, itcutsthemagne-
ticfieldbetween thepole-pieces {S,N)
ofthemagnet andacurrent isinduced
intheconductor. Inposition (1)the
sides abandcdoftheconductor are
momentarily moving parallel tothelines
ofmagnetic force sothere isnocutting
andnoinduced E.M.F. Therefore no
electrons will flow. Inposition (2)the
coil iscutting anincreasing number of
lines offorce sotheinduced E.M.F. is
increasing. Electrons flow inthedirec-
tionabed soastoproduce anN-pole and
anS-pole inthe coilwhich willoppose
itsmotion (Lenz’s Law). Electrons are
now leaving the slip ring B,passing
through thelamp, andreturning toA.
Inposition (3)theconductor iscutting
themaximum number oflines offorce
and theinduced E.M.F. andinduced
electron flow areatamaximum. Asthe
321
Chap. 28 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
coil reaches position (4) theelectron
flow isdecreasing and, inposition (5)
asthemotion isparallel tothe lines of
force once more, itceases entirely. In
(6)theelectron flow builds upagain
but thistime inthedirection dcba so
that electrons leave slip ring A,pass
through thelamp, andreturn through B.
The current again reaches amaximum
in(7), decreases in(8),and falls to
zero inposition (9). Thus, during one
complete rotation ofthe coil, the in-
duced current starts atzero, increases
toamaximum, falls tozero, increases
toamaximum intheopposite direc-
tion, and again falls tozero. Thesechanges aresummarized inFig. 28:7.
Acurrent with such characteristics is
said tobeanalternating current (A.C.)
andonecycle hasbeen described above.
Alternating current isprovided byall
hydro-electric installations. Those who
have lived in,orvisited, 25-cycle power
areas willhave noticed therapid flicker-
ingofthe lights. This iscaused bythe
reversal ofcurrent flow occurring 25
times persecond. When thenumber of
reversals isincreased to60times per
second asin60-cycle power, this flick-
ering isnotnoticeable. Very fewareas
oftheworld still use this 25-cycle
power.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION Sec.V:64
V:63 THEDIRECT-CURRENT
GENERATOR
When electrons flow continuously in
one direction itissaid tobeadirect
current. Such current isrequired for
special installations such aselectroplat-
ing. Inorder toobtain direct current
from anA.C. generator, acommutator
must beused inplace ofthe sliprings
(Chap. 31,Exp. 39B). Forasingle-coil
generator asdescribed insection V:62,
thecommutator consists ofacollecting-
ringmade oftwosegments orcom-

mutator bars insulated from each other.
Each bar isconnected toaterminal of
thecoil (Fig. 28:8).
The brushes aresoplaced thatthey
restontheinsulating material between
thebars attheinstant when the elec-trons areabout toreverse direction. Thus
thecommutator barschange brushes just
astheelectron flow reverses sothat the
current flowing through the external
circuit isalways inthesame direction
(Fig. 28:9).
Thecurrent from asingle turn ofwire
isclearly apulsating current. Toelim-
inate thisthearmature ofacommercial
generator consists ofmany such coilseach
with itscommutator arranged around
theshaft (Fig. 28:10). Suchanarrange-
ment willgive amore continuous flow
ofcurrent, since some ofthe coils will

mobiles, electrical systems inremote
places, direct-current generating systems
inschools, hospitals, etc.,andforelectro-
plating andelectro-purification ofmetals.
V :64TRANSFORMERS
Transformers areused tochange the
voltage inanA.C. circuit asrequired.
Atransformer consists oftwoseparate
coils ofinsulated wire, theprimary and
secondary coils,wound onthesame soft
ironcore (Fig. 28:11). Alternating cur-
rents from agenerator flowthrough the
windings oftheinput orprimary coil.
Asthecurrent changes inintensity and
direction, themagnetic field surround-
ingthecoilchanges aswell.Thus lines
323
Chap. 28 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
ofmagnetic force ofchanging strength
anddirection aremade tocuttheturns
oftheoutput orsecondary coil.An
alternating E.M.F. isinduced inthe
secondary coil. Since themagnitude of
Fig.28:11 Step-up Transformer.
theinduced E.M.F. isproportional to
thenumber ofturns oftheconductor
cutbythechanging magnetic field, the
strength oftheinduced voltage may be
varied byusing adifferent number of
turns intheprimary and secondary
windings. Foranytransformer—
Output Voltage_No.ofturns onsecondary coil

Astep-up transformer hasmore turns
onthesecondary coil than onthe
primary coiland soserves toincrease or
“step up” the voltage. Astep-down
transformer hasmore turnsontheprim-
ary coilthanonthesecondary and so
serves todecrease or“step down” the
voltage.
InsectionV :75, itwillbeestablished
that thepower ofanelectric current=
thenumber ofvoltsXthenumber of
amperes. Obviously thepower ofthe
secondary current must equal thepower
oftheprimary current (except fora
very small decrease owing toconversion
toheat). Thus, ifastep-up transformer
causes avoltage rise, there must bea
corresponding fall inthecurrent.
Students will befamiliar with the
small step-down transformers used to
operate electric trains, electric bellsand
electric janitors around thehome. Some
other uses ofthetransformer will be

compressed toavaiying degree. This,
inturn, causes their electrical resistance
tovaryand fluctuations inthecurrent
strength areproduced atthesame fre-

ingcurrent istransmitted tothe re-

V:66 SELF-INDUCTANCE
Ithasbeen observed thatwhen an
electric circuit isbroken, aswhen a
switch inahouse-lighting circuit is
turned off,aspark or“electric arc” fre-
quently occurs. This iscaused byself-
inductance which isexplained below.
When acoil ofwire ofmany turns,
wound about aniron core, isconnected
toabattery, thecurrent that begins to
flow causes amagnetic field about the
wire. Asanincreasing number oflines

willbeinduced inthecoil itself causing
acurrent toflow inadirection opposite
totheflow ofcurrent inthecoil(Lenz’s
Law). Thus thecurrent willbuild uo
more slowly thanmight beexpected in
such acircuit (Chap. 31,Exp. 40).
When theconnection tothebattery
isbroken, thedecreasing current causes
adecreasing magnetic field about the
wires.AnE.M.F. causing acurrent that
flows inthesame direction asthemain
current will result. Since this isofrela-
tively high voltage, adefinite spark (arc)
willbeobserved. Inacircuit, aninduced
current thatopposes anychange inthe
flow ofcurrent through itcaused by
self-inductance iscalled aself-induced
current. Itissosimilar totheinertia of
matter that ithasbeen termed electro-
magnetic inertia. It isanimportant
consideration inallalternating-current
equipment design.
V :67THEINDUCTION COIL
The induction coil isvery like the
transformer inconstruction, asboth con-
sistofprimary andsecondary coils of
different numbers ofturns ofwirewound
about acommon softiron core.Whereas
thetransformer can utilize thechanging
magnetic fieldcaused byalternating cur-
rent tostepupthevoltage, thesame
operation isimpossible with adirect
current forlack ofchanging magnetic
field. However, itispossible toobtain
high voltage from alowvoltage direct
current bytheuseofaninduction coil.
This isaccomplished bycontinually
interrupting theprimary current, with
theaidofacircuit breaker similar to
that inthe electric bell (Sec. V:50).
This results inachanging magnetic field
around theprimary which induces ahigh
voltage current inthesecondary coil.
This device was firstinvented byPage
intheUnited States in1836and later
reinvented byRuhmkorff inEurope in
1851.The induction coil (Fig. 28:15)
consists ofaprimary coilTofafew
turns ofthick insulated copper wire
wound about asoftironcoreBwhich is
not solid but built upfrom abundle
ofsoftiron wires toprevent self-induc-
tion effects. Around theprimary coil is
asecondary coilCconsisting ofmany
turns ofvery finecopper wirewound
insections with parafifined-paper insula-
tionbetween thelayers ofeach section.
Theprimary circuit iscompleted through
Secondary Terminals
amake-and-break device D.This con-
sists ofastiffpiece ofspring steelwith a
soft ironarmature onone sideand a
platinum (ortungsten) contact onthe
other. Itisnormally incontact with the
platinum (ortungsten) point onthe
end oftheadjusting screw. Asthe
primary current flows, thecorebecomes
magnetized and attracts thearmature,
thereby breaking thecircuit. Themag-
netism ofthecorenow collapses andthe
armature thus released isdrawn backby
thespring tomake contact with the
screw. The primary circuit isagain
complete fortheaction toberepeated.
Asthemagnetic field oftheprimary
circuit builds upand collapses ateach
make andbreak, analternating induced
327
Chap. 28 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
E.M.F. issetupinthesecondary coil.
This E.M.F. may bemany tens of
thousands ofvoltsandcancause aspark
several inches long topassbetween the
terminals ofthesecondary coil. One-
half ofeach alternation hasamuch
greater E.M.F. than theother (Sec.
V:60). Asaresult thiscurrent usually
isviewed asapulsating direct current.
Inactual practice theweaker ofthetwo
ispractically eliminated bytheuseof
acondenser.
Induction coilscanbeused foroper-
ating X-ray tubes, although modern
tubes aremainly transformer operated.
They arealsoemployed insome forms
oflaboratory research where moderately
high voltages arerequired, and inthe
ignition systems ofautomobiles.
Note: Because ofthevery large self-
inductance oftheprimary winding, the
upbuilding anddecay oftheprimary
current areboth delayed, andtheslower
changes inthemagnetic fieldmean cor-
respondingly reduced voltages inthe
secondary coil.Theself-induced forward
E.M.F. intheprimary circuit atthe
break causes arcing across thecontact
points which become considerably worn
asaresult. Toprevent thisacondenser
E,formed from alternate sheets oftin-
foilandparaffined-paper, isplaced across
themake andbreak, andtheself-induced
current atbreak surges into thecon-
denser instead ofarcing across thepoints,
thereby producing avery rapid break.
Thecondenser plates, however, arecon-
nected through theprimary winding, and
nosooner isthecondenser charged than
itdischarges through theprimary coil,
producing acurrent initinadirection
opposite tothenowupbuilding current
from thebattery. Aswasnoted before
(Sec. V:60), theinduced current is
weaker atthemake than atthebreak.
Thecondenser weakens itstill further.
Accordingly, thecoilproduces practicallyapulsating, direct current ofhigher
E.M.F. than that oftheprimary.

CHAPTER 29 ELECTRICAL ENERGY
V:70 THEPRODUCTION OF
ELECTRICITY
Notmany years agoCanada was
known throughout theworld asanagri-
cultural country. Asurvey ofourexports
atthebeginning ofthetwentieth century
shows thatfarm products formed the
basis ofoureconomy. Intheyears pre-
ceding theSecond World War agradual
swing towards greater industrial ex-
pansion could benoted. From those
years tothepresent time thechange has
been almost phenomenal. Canada has
become anindustrial nation. Our ex-
ports now, while stillincluding alarge
part oftheworld wheat supply andother
agricultural commodities, have been ex-
panded totake incountless manufactured
articles ranging from heavy farm
machinery topaper, clothing, electrical
devices, chemicals andproducts ofmin-
ingandsmelting.
Closely connected with these changes
hasbeen themarvellous development of
Canada’s hydro-electric power resources.
The energy offalling water hasbeen
harnessed toturn thehuge turbines
which rotate thearmatures oflarge gen-
erators (Fig. 29:1). Steam-generating
plants havebecome common inwhichtheenergy from coal isutilized. Inre-
cent years heatfrom anatomic pile is
being used inthesame way. These
latter methods provide thealternating
current that issovital toourmodern
way oflife. Millions ofhorsepower have
beenmade available toturn thewheels
ofindustry across thecountry and to
provide theluxuries ofcheap electricity
inourhomes. Men offoresight have
planned fornewand greater feats in
engineering asthey divert thewaterways,
tunnel through mountains andimprove
thegenerators toprovide Canada with
power forthefuture.
V:71 THETRANSMISSION OF
ELECTRICITY
Every high-school student knows that
electrical energy isreadily transformed
intoheat energy. Acurrent ofelectricity
consists ofashunting offreeelectrons in
thecircuit. Theenergy ofthese electrons
isconverted intoheat astheyencounter
opposition totheir motion inthecon-
ductor. Itisapparent that thegreater
thenumber ofelectrons moving andthe
greater theresistance oftheconductor,
thegreater willbetheamount ofheat
produced. In1841, James Joule proved
experimentally that theheat produced
was proportional tothesquare ofthe
current, tothe resistance, and tothe
time thecurrent flowed {HaPRt).
Itisevident then that theamount of
current inaconductor isthemost im-
portant single factor inheat losses dur-

Ingthetransmission ofelectricity. The
power ofanelectric current isequal to
thevoltage times thecurrent strength,
i.e.,P—VI(Sec. V;75). This iscon-
stant foragiven current. Thus, ifthe
voltage ismade higher, thecurrent be-
comes smaller and heat losses will be
reduced. For thisreason, alternating cur-
rentproduced atapotential difference
of2,200 to12,000 volts isstepped upto
between 50,000 and 220,000 volts for
transmission. Atthe sub-station the
voltage isstepped down bytransformers
sothat thepole voltage isusually about
2,200 volts. The familiar pole trans-
formers step thisdown further to220
and110volts forhousehold circuits. This
current isused tooperate electric ranges,
heaters, lights and various other appli-
ances.

placed inspecial boxes nearwhere the

V:74 OTHER APPLICATIONS OFTHE
HEATING EFFECT
(a)Domestic Heating Appliances
Nowadays, inmany homes, space
heaters, hot-water heaters, ranges, etc.,
useelectricity. The appliances designed
forthese various purposes contain heat-
ing-elements usually made of“nichrome”resistance wire. This isanalloy ofnickel
(80%) andcopper (20%) which can
beheated toahightemperature without
melting, andoxidizing very slowly even
when red hot. Inaddition, ithasa
resistance ofabout sixty times that of
copper and thisreduces the costs.
Inelectric heaters, the heating-ele-
ments aregenerally supported on fire-
clay forms, and insome ofthesmaller
heaters concave polished metal reflectors
areused toconcentrate theradiant heat
into abeam. The electric range has
nichrome heating-elements embedded in
some suitable insulating material forpro-
tection. The elements often consist of
two parts. When theswitch issetat

(Fig. 29:6). The walls and door of
theoven are filled with heat-insulating
material such asfibre glass toreduce the
heat loss, theoven temperature being
regulated bysome form ofthermostat.
With electric irons (Fig. 29:7) the
heating-elements areusually wound on
insulating-sheets ofmica situated near
the“sole” ofthe iron. These heating-
elements arecovered byalayer ofasbes-
tosandabove this isaheavy iron plate

kettles arealsoprovided withnichrome

these, sandwiched between mica strips,

(h)TheElectric Arc
Iftwocarbon rods arejoined across
anelectric supply ofnot lessthan 45
volts, and theends ofthecarbons are
touched together, anintensely brilliant
“arc” ofwhite light appears between
theends oftherodsondrawing themslowly apart. Thisphenomenon was dis-
covered byDavy in1806, using two
thousand simple cellsandcharcoal rods.
These rodswere later replaced bygas
carbon and the intensity ofthe light
produced bythismeans ledtotheex-
tensive useofelectric “arc lamps” in
street lighting towards theend ofthe
nineteenth century. Arc lights areused
asspotlights intheatres.
Theheavy current passing onstrik-
ingthearcproduces intense heat be-
tween thecarbon tipswhich arethus
raised toincandescence. The arc-like
flame consists ofwhite-hot particles of
carbon tornfrom oneoftherodswhich
thus steadily wears away. Ifused with
aD.C. supply the positive carbon is
consumed twice asquickly asthenega-
tiverod,and itisfound thata“crater”
develops attheendofit.Almost allthe
light originates atthis“positive crater,”
thetemperature ofwhich isabout
3500°C.

discharge points ofwhich are close
together. The induction coil isturned
onwhile thetube isbeing evacuated
(Chap. 31,Exp, 42). At first adis-
charge occurs between the discharge
points but, asthetube ispartially evacu-
ated, thecurrent ceases between the
points and begins between the ter-
minals inside thetube even though
they arefarther apart. This discharge,
though varying inappearance with the
degree ofevacuation, continues even
though thetube isevacuated ascom-
pletely aspossible.
The current flows through thegas at
reduced pressure because thegas be-
comes ionized. The electrons expelled
from theatoms ofgasareattracted to
theanode where they re-enter themetal-
licpart ofthe circuit. The positively
charged gaseous ions areattracted to
thecathode where they remove elec-
trons from it.
Where theelectricity ispassing through
avacuum, electrons areexpelled from
thecathode andproceed instraight lines
directly totheanode. Thebehaviour of
electricity asitpasses through agasor
avacuum isknown aselectronics.

V:78 CATHODE RAYS
Themain characteristics ofthe dis-
charge ofelectricity through gasesmay
beshown bythesame method aswas
used insection V:77(b). Atnormal
pressures theinsulating properties ofthe
gasaretoogreat foraspark tooccur,
butasthepressure isreduced acurrent
ispassed and irregular streamers of
light traverse thetubebetween theelec-
trodes each ofwhich issurrounded by
aluminous glow. With continued low-
ering ofthe pressure the discharge
broadens out toasteady luminous col-
umnwhich extends from theanode to
almost asfarasthecathode. This is
known asthe positive column and is
separated from thecathode glow bya
dark space called theFaraday dark
space. The pressure inthegasatthis
stage isabout 5mm. ofmercury. Fur-
therreduction inthepressure ofthegas
toabout 1mm. causes the positive
column toshrink and tobreak upinto
alternate lightanddark patches known
asstriations. TheFaraday dark space
increases insize atthislow pressure,
andthecathode glowmoves away from
thecathode, leaving adark space be-
tween itand thecathode called the
Crookes’ dark space (Fig. 30:2). When
thepressure isabout 0.1mm. theposi-
tivecolumn disappears altogether and
thenegative glow becomes consider-
ably extended. At stilllower pressures
the negative glow disappears, the
Crookes’ dark space filling the tube,
and the glass walls ofthetube, par-ticularly near theanode end, shine with
abright green fluorescent light. The
phenomena occurring atthisstage ofthe
discharge proved tobemost important.

that therayswere shot out atright

they carried anegative charge (Chap.

Itwas SirJ.J.Thomson, inEngland,
however, whoshowed inaseries of
masterly experiments, carried outatthe
close ofthenineteenth century, that the

tively electrified particles which wenow

inwhich the rays were deflected by
bothmagnetic and electric fields, hewas
able tocalculate their velocity and also

other means, and sohewas able to
obtain avalue forthemass oftheelec-
tronwhich heshowed tobeabout 1/1840

While experimenting with discharge
tubes atvery low pressure, Roentgen,
inGermany, in1895, noted that a
fluorescent screen some distance away
glowed brightly evenwhen thedischarge
tubewascovered with black paper, and

objects placed between thetube and
screen produced shadows. Roentgen at-
tributed these effects toanewform of
radiation emanating from the tube,
which, onaccount of itsunknown
nature, wascalled X-rays.
It isnowknown that X-rays, or
Roentgen rays, areproduced whenever
cathode raysimpinge onasolid object
(Chap. 31,Exp. 44). Fig.30:3 shows
amodern form ofX-ray tube inwhich
the electrons, constituting thecathode
stream, originate from aheated filament

cavecathode ontoatungsten ormolyb-
denum target setinablock ofcopper
called theanti-cathode. The face of
theanti-cathode issetatanangle of
45° totheaxis ofthetube, theX-rays

Most oftheenergy ofthecathode stream
isdissipated asheat, only about 1per
cent oftheenergy isconverted into
X-rays.
X-rays travel instraight lines, arenot

fields andproduce fluorescence insuit-
able materials such asplatinum-bariumcyanide, which isthesubstance fre-
quently usedonX-ray viewing-screens.
They affect photographic plates, produce
chemical changes, and arecapable of
discharging electrified bodies since they
ionize the air. X-rays are electro-
magnetic waves ofthesame nature as
visible orultra-violet raysbuthaving a
verymuch shorter wave-length. One of
themost characteristic properties ofthe
rays istheir penetrating power. They
can pass through many substances

V :80THEELECTRONIC TUBE
Just asatapacts asavalve tocontrol
theflow ofwater through thepipes ofa
house, sotheelectronic tube acts asa
valve tocontrol theflow ofelectrons
inanelectric circuit (Chap. 31,Exp.
45,46). Electronic tubes areable to
increase ordecrease theamount ofcur-
rent flow, oreven tostart orstop it,and
theaction isimmediate. They useprac-
tically nopower inthe circuit. No
attempt willbemade inthis text todo
anymore than tooutline thestructure
andaction ofthesimplest forms ofthese
tubes.
(a)Structure
Any electronic tube hasfour basic
parts (Fig. 30:4):1.Aglass metal envelope enclosing the
tube serves tosustain thevacuum or
lowpressure within thetube;
2.Acathode, which isheated either
directly byanelectric current orin-
directly byaheater element which
carries thecurrent, serves togive ofT
theelectrons when heated;
3.Ananode serves toreceive theelec-
tronsfrom thecathode;
4.Abasewhich hasfour oreight ter-
minals orprongs forconnecting the
tube into itscircuit.
Such atube iscalled adiode. A
triode hasanadditional part called the
grid (part d).
(b)Action
When thetube isconnected into a
circuit, the circuit isactually broken.
When thecathode isheated electrons

leave itssurface. Ifapositive charge is
applied totheanode, these electrons will
beattracted across theintervening space
and thus aflow ofelectrons willoccur
(Fig. 30:5). Theanode isfrequently
referred toasthe‘‘plate” andthecurrent
344
ELECTRONICS Sec.V:80
passing through theplate iscalled the
“plate current”.
(c)Rectification
Iftheanode isconnected toanalter-
nating-current circuit (Fig. 30:6) itwill
bealternately positiv^ely and negatively
charged. While theanode ispositive
electrons willflowfrom thecathode to
theanode andthrough theplate circuit.
During those half cycles when theanode
isnegative, the electrons about the

trons areAttracted OnlyWhen Plate

cathode willberepelled andnocurrent
will flow. Thus the current passes
through thetube inonedirection only,
from cathode toanode, andadirect
current flows intheplate circuit. The
tube hasbeen used toobtain direct cur-
rentfrom analternating-current supply.
Such aprocess iscalled rectification.
Thetubeused forthepurpose isdesig-
nated arectifier tube. Half-wave recti-
fication byadiode isillustrated in
Fig.30:7.
(d)Amplification
Atriode tube hasafifth part called
thegrid (Fig. 30:8) which controls the
current passing through thetube. The
grid isaspecial wire ormesh between
thecathode andtheanode. Anychange
ingrid voltage causes aproportional
change intheamount ofcurrent flowing
through thetube. Thus, ifwehave a
veryweak alternating current, tooweak
tobeused directly, itwould beapplied
tothegrid asasignal voltage. Asthe
gridvoltage varies itcauses anidentical
amplified variation intheplate current.
The grid isgiven anegative charge just
large enough that itnever actually be-
comes positive when thesignal isapplied.Thus, noelectrons areattracted tothe
grid itself sothetube operates atmaxi-
mum efficiency. Fig.30:9 illustrates this
amplification action asaradio signal is
impressed onthegrid ofthe triode.

RECEPTION
The triode tube canbeused asan
oscillator which ismerely atype of
alternating-current generator capable of
providing frequencies intheorder of
150,000 to1,500,000 cycles ormore per
second. Asthese variations incurrent
areimpressed onatransmitting antenna,
electromagnetic waves, called carrier
waves, aresent outinto space. Inthe
transmitting-studio amicrophone trans-
forms sound waves into afluctuating
direct current. This current isused to
modulate, orcause variations in,the
amplitude ofthecarrier waves from the
oscillator.
Atthereceiving-station thevarying
electromagnetic waves induce minute
potential differences intheantenna.
Certain ofthese, selected bythetuning
circuit, areimpressed onthegrid of
anamplifier where they cause corres-
pondingly larger variations intheplate
current oftheamplifier tube. These
currents pass toadetector circuit in
which another electronic tube separates
theaudio frequency component ofthe
wave (i.e., thepart thatcanbecon-
verted toaudible sound) from theradio
frequency ofthe carrier wave. These
audio frequency components arefurther
amplified andused tooperate thedia-
phragm ofearphones oramagnetic

30:10. Students desiring further infor-
mation ontheprinciples and structure

Ajnateurs’ Handbook orspecialized texts
onradio.
V:82 PHOTOELECTRICITY
Photoelectric cells or,asthey arecom-
monly called, ‘‘electric eyes”, are the
result ofalmost onehundred years of
careful investigation. In1888, Hall-
wacks, aGerman scientist, found that
negatively charged zinc plates lost their
charges when exposed toultra-violet
light coming from anarc-lamp (Fig.
30:11). Thus electrons wereshown to
bereleased from certain substances
when light fallsupon them. This effect
may bedemonstrated visually ifazinc
plate isattached toanelectroscope
(Chap. 31,Exp. 47). This iscalled
photo-emission ofelectrons.
Ashort time later itwasdiscovered
that thealkali metals, sodium, potassium
andcaesium are sensitive even toor-
dinary visible light. Modern emissive
type photoelectric cells usethese metals
and aresimilar inappearance toradio
vacuum-tubes. Alayer oflight-sensitive
metal coats theentire inner surface of

trons from allsides asthey arereleased
(Fig. 30:12). The rate ofelectron emis-
sion isproportional totheamount and

Such cells control circuits which areused

duction. Itconsists ofametal support-

Since the intensity ofthebeam and

The illusion ofacontinuous picture is
explained bytherapidity ofscanning

Television waves travel inastraight
path. Each transmitter’s coverage isan
area with aradius ofabout 130miles
onaccount oftheearth’s curvature (Fig.
32:5). Obviously, thispresents aprob-
lem intelecasting events ofnational
importance from coast tocoast. To
overcome thedifficulty aseries ofrelay
stations (Fig. 32:6) hasbeen developed
which isused both fortelevision and
telephone conversations using shortwaves
called microwaves tocarry theenergy.
Each frequency carries several messages.
Waves ofthiskindcanbefocused and

each signal puts itsown corresponding

isdotted with “phosphors” that will
glow red,green orblue,when properly
stimulated. When allthree phosphors
aremade toglow bytheir respective
electron beams, the original scene is

Radar
Theword radar isacontraction ofthe
words Radio Detection AndRanging
which gives agood idea ofwhat it
means.Man hasknown forcenturies that
echoes areuseful indetecting distant
obstacles anddetermining their position.
Weknow that thebatuses theecho ofhishigh-pitched squeak toenable him to
avoid objects ashefliesbackand forth
inthedark. Mariners have used the
echo oftheship’s whistle tolocate shore-
lines and icebergs. High frequency
radio waves (300 to3000megacycles per
second) areused forthesame purpose
inradar. Atthese frequencies they re-
semble lightwaves andcanbereflected,
refracted and focused. Like light they
travel instraight lines. Theradar prin-
ciple, firstused in1924 inexploring the
upper regions oftheearth’s atmosphere
wasadapted bySirRobert Watson Watt
forthelocation ofaircraft, ships and
shorelines inWorld War II. Itwas this
device which enabled those fewvaliant
defenders oftheBritish Isles(and ofthe
freedom oftheworld) during theBattle
ofBritain toearn those remarkable
words ofSirWinston Churchill when he
said,“Never . . .wassomuch owed by

TheElectron Microscope
Itcanbeshown that theability ofa
microscope toreveal the fine detail of
anobject (the resolving power) islim-
itedbythewave-length ofthelight used.
Consequently, thepractical upper limit
ofmagnifying power thatcanbeobtain-
edwith optical microscopes—using visi-
blelight—isabout 2000 diameters. Now
itisknown thatanelectron stream be-
haves inamanner very similar toalight
beam butwithaneffective wave-length
some 10,000 times smaller, permitting
examination ofbacteria, viruses andvery
large molecules.
Accordingly scientists, especially Dr.F.
Burton and hisassociates attheUni-
versity ofToronto inthe1930’s explored
thepossibility ofusing electrons inmic-
roscopy. Asaresult oftheir researches
theelectron microscope, shown diagram-
matically inFig. 32:9, wasdeveloped.
The electrons areproduced byaheated
cathode and areaccelerated under a
potential ofsome 50,000 volts applied to
ananode with acentral holefromwhich
theyemerge inastream ofswiftly mov-
ing electrons. The electron stream is

“magnetic lenses” consist ofshort sol-
enoids entirely encased inasteel shield

NUCLEAR PHYSICS
InSection V:12, thecomposition of
theatom was presented without any
supporting evidence. There thecom-
ponents—electrons, protons, neutrons,
nucleus, orbits—were defined. This
knowledge oftheatom came about by
aprocess ofgradual evolution. First
was thediscovery oftheelectron by
SirJ.J.Thomson asaresult ofhis
work oncathode rays (Sec. V;78).
Later, studies onradioactivity contri-
buted much toknowledge about the
nucleus oftheatom.
Radioactivity
In1896 theFrench physicist Becquerel
noticed that salts ofuranium affected a
neighbouring photographic plate. He
concluded that these saltsmust beemit-
tingrays orparticles spontaneously gen-erated bythe salts themselves. This
phenomenon wascalled radioactivity and
was extensively investigated byPierre
andMarie Curie. Using pitch-blende, a
natural orerich inuranium compounds,
they succeeded, after along series of
repeated crystallizations, inisolating two
new elements, polonium and radium,
which were more radioactive than
y-Rays

uranium. Later work bytheCuries and
others hasrevealed, indeed, that quite a
number oftheheavier elements are
radioactive.
Fig.32:11 TheUranium Disintegration Series.
397
Chap. 32 MAGNETISM ANDELECTRICITY
In1903 Rutherford undertook a
careful examination ofthenature ofthe
radiation from radioactive substances.
Heshowed, byapplying amagnetic
field, Fig. 32:10, that the radiation
could beresolved into three distinct
groups ofrayswhich hecalled alpha (a),
beta(/?),andgamma(y)rays, the
a-rays being deflected inone direction,
the /?-rays intheopposite direction,
while they-rays donotundergo de-
flection. Further experiments showed
that thea-rays were positively charged
helium nuclei, the/?-rays, negative elec-
trons, and that they-rays were highly
penetrating, short wave-length, energy
waves. Rutherford came totheconclu-
sion that thenuclei ofradioactive sub-
stances arespontaneously disintegrating
into theabove raysandchanging into
newelements astheydoso.Fig.32:11
shows thesequence ofchanges throughwhich uranium goes as itgradually
changes into lead.
TheStructure oftheAtom
Rutherford found that a-particles
would pass through athin sheet of
metal, andconcluded that there was
considerable empty space intheatom.
Hisconcept oftheatom wasaminia-
ture solar system consisting ofelectrons
revolving about apositively charged
nucleus. Later, while atMcGill Uni-
versity, hewasable toisolate thehydro-
gen ionorproton. Moseley’s experi-
ments, inEngland, with X-ray phe-
nomena onvarious elements, indicated
thepresence ofthese protons inevery
nucleus andadifferent number inthe
nuclei ofdifferent elements. Thenumber
ofprotons inthenucleus oftheatom is
theatomic number ornuclear charge.
Since theatom iselectrically neutral, the

number ofelectrons revolving about the
nucleus must equal thenumber ofpro-
tons inthenucleus, andhence must also
equal theatomic number.
Rutherford’s atom served until the
discovery bySirJames Chadwick in
1932 ofthe neutron. This particle
(which was earlier predicted byRuth-
erford) hasthesame mass astheproton
but possesses nocharge. Itisnow be-
lieved thatatomic nuclei are built up
ofprotons and neutrons. Thesum of
theprotons plus theneutrons make up
what iscalled themassnumber ofthe
atom. Ingeneral thenumber ofneutrons
inthenucleus isequal tothemass
number minus thenuclear charge or
atomic number. Forexample, thehelium
nucleus which hasanatomic number
of2andamassnumber of4must con-
tain 2protons and 2neutrons.
Finally, tocomplete thepicture ofthe
atom, Niels Bohr postulated that the
electrons revolved invarious orbits, or
energy levels, about thenucleus. The
Bohr Concept foranumber oftypical
atoms isshown inFig.32:12.
Isotopes
About thistime, itwasdiscovered by
Rutherford andAston inEngland that
although allatoms ofanelement have
thesame chemical properties some dif-
fered from others inmass. Such forms
ofanyelement arecalled isotopes. They
postulated that alltheisotopes ofany
oneelement must have thesamenum-
berofprotons and electrons andhence
thesame atomic number, butmust differ
inthenumber ofneutrons inthenuc-
leusandhence must differ inmassnum-ber.Most elements consist ofanumber
ofisotopes. Forexample, hydrogen is
thought toconsist ofamixture ofthree
isotopes (Fig. 32:13). Protium isthe
commonest isotope ofhydrogen. Deu-
terium istheisotope ofhydrogen that
isfound inheavy water. The nucleus
ofdeuterium, called adeuteron, is
much used inexperimental work in
nuclear physics. Tritium isavery rare
isotope ofhydrogen that isofimpor-
tance inthehydrogen bomb.
Artificial Transmutation
Theabove interpretation ofnatural
radioactivity suggested toRutherford the
possibility ofbringing about thedisinte-
gration ofother nuclei. This was ac-
complished byRutherford in1919 while
atMcGill byusing a-particles from a
radioactive source tobombard nitrogen
atoms. Asaresult ofthe collisions he
found thatsome ofthenitrogen atoms
had aproton ejected from them, the
a-particle remaining with thedisrupted
nucleus. These atoms therefore hada
netincrease of 1proton and 2neutrons
andhence became oxygen atoms (actu-
allyaheavy isotope ofoxygen) :
14 4 1 17NHe-^P +O
7 218
Thus was achieved the first artificial
transmutation oftheelements—theold
alchemists’ dream becoming areality!
Rutherford next considered theuseof
artificially energized particles asamore
effective means ofbringing about nuclear
changes, using protons accelerated under
apotential difference ofabout half a
million volts. These high-speed protons
were directed ontoalithium target.

Other light elements were disintegrated
bythismeans, but itwas realized that
evenmore energetic particles were re-
quired toattack thenuclei ofheavier
elements onaccount ofthelarge forces
ofrepulsion between thebombarding
particles and thelarger nuclear positive
charge. Particles having thenecessary
energy forthispurpose canbeproduced
bymeans ofthecyclotron (Fig. 32:14).
This latter machine, first invented by
theAmerican physicists Lawrence and
Livingston in1930, iscapable ofrapidly
accelerating charged particles such as
protons anddeuterons.
Nuclear Fission
Thediscovery oftheneutron provided
physicists with amost effective projectile
with which tobombard atomic nucleibecause, having nocharge, aneutron
canapproach the positive nucleus of
anatom without anyrepulsive force.A
common way ofproducing neutrons for
thispurpose istobombard beryllium

knocked outoftheberyllium nuclei. It
waswhile bombarding uranium 235 (a
light unstable isotope ofuranium) with
neutrons in1939, thatHahn and Strass-

MODERN DEVELOPMENTS INPHYSICS
mann discovered anentirely new foiTn
ofnuclear transformation, Nuclear Fis-
sion, inwhich theuranium nucleus was
split intotwonearly equal parts with
therelease ofalargeamount ofenergy
(Fig. 32:15). Another interesting fea-
ture ofthe fission ofuranium isthat
during theprocess further neutrons are
emitted inrelatively larger numbers than
those absorbed. Thus from each uran-
ium nucleus undergoing fission two or
more neutrons arereleased. The neu-
trons soreleased canthen cause fission
inother uranium nuclei and sooncaus-
ingachain reaction. Ifallowed to
proceed inthisway, provided that there
isasuitable amount offissionable matter
present, thewhole ofthematerial is
transformed inavery short time, with
therelease ofvast quantities ofenergy.
This istheprinciple oftheatomic bomb.
Ithasbeen proven that thecombined
mass oftheproducts isalittle lessthan
themass oforiginal material. Dr.Al-
bert Einstein asearly as1905 using his
famous equation, E=;MC^, predicted
whatwenowknow—that themass lost
becomes transformed into theenergy of
theexplosion. Erepresents theenergy,Mthe loss inmass and C,aconstant
quantity equal tothespeed oflight (Sec.
IV:6).Thuswecan seethat asmall
amount ofmass istransformed into a
tremendous amount ofenergy.
Nuclear Reactors
Iftheneutrons from the fission ofU
235 areabsorbed orslowed down as
they areproduced, thechain reaction
canbecontrolled and theenergy re-
leased put touseful purposes. Graphite
andcertain other light substances which
possess theproperty ofabsorbing neu-
trons, areused tocontrol therate of
neutron emission inatomic fission and
arecalled moderators. Theassembly of
uranium (orother fissile material) and
graphite (intheform ofblocks orrods)isknown asanatomic pileornuclear
reactor (page 402), therate ofenergy
release being controlled byadjusting the
length ofthegraphite rods inserted in
the pile.Theenergy released istrans-
fomied intoheatwhich isused forvari-
ouspurposes. Energy isvariously mea-
sured. The engineer may express itas
B.T.U. perpound (Sec. 111:20). The
nuclear physicist may express itinelec-
tron volts peratom. OneB.T.U. equals
665X10^^ million electron volts. Itis
estimated that, ifcoal gives 13,600
B.T.U. perpound, this is4electron volts
peratom ofcarbon. Bycomparison one
atom ofuranium produces 200million
electron volts. This means that one
atom ofuranium produces 50million
times asmuch energy asoneatom of
carbon or ifyouhave equal masses of
coalanduranium theamount ofenergy
released from theuranium is3million
times asgreat. There islittle wonder,
therefore, that thesearch foruranium
goesonatafeverish pace.
Atomic Fusion
In1951whenmanwascongratulating
himself onhisconquest oftheatom
through turning fission tohisadvan-
tage, anew and stillmore exciting
process was evolved byDr.Edward
Teller intheUnited States. You will
recall Hans Bethe’s theory oftheorigin
ofthesun’s continuous heatbytheunion
offouratoms ofhydrogen toform an
atom ofhelium accompanied bythecon-
version ofasmall amount ofmass into
energy (Sec. Ill:3). Dr. Teller em-
ployed thisprocess using theisotopes of
hydrogen—protium, deuterium and tri-
tium—resulting intheproduction ofa
source ofenergy fargreater than ever
realized before. The hydrogen bomb
wascreated which was fantastically de-
vastating. Asource ofenergy wasborn
thatwassoamazing that itmay wellbe
thesource ofenergy ofthefuture.
