Preface
“Inorder toleadmystudents totheconviction which Ihave reached myself, I
wish toplace them onthesame path asthatbywhich Iarrived atit—thepath
that isofthehistorical examination ofchemical theories.”
S.Cannizzaro
Chemistry forSecondary Schools isanattempt topresent chemistry
inanattractive andinteresting manner notonly tostudents whowish
tobecome professional chemists, butalso tothemajority ofhigh
school students who willnothave further formal instruction butwill
require some knowledge ofthesubject inorder tohave abetter
understanding ofthemodern world inwhich they live.
The historical approach followed inthetextendeavours toshow
themanner inwhich thescience hasdeveloped, inthehope thatthe
student willbeguided toreason along thesame lines asthegreat
men ofchemistry have reasoned. The universality ofthescience of
chemistry isaccentuated bythestudy ofthecontributions made by
men ofevery country. Themanner inwhich these ideas have been
accepted andinterchanged should demonstrate tolerance andteach
anappreciation ofinternational good willandco-operation.
Basic principles ofatomic andmolecular structures aregiven to
enable astudent toretain factswithout leaving himself entirely atthe
mercy ofhismemory. Inevery instance aclear-cut distinction is
drawn between theory and fact.Many theories arediscussed and
reasons aregiven foraccepting some, modifying others, anddiscarding
those obviously outmoded bynew discoveries andincreased know-
ledge. Consistent with theaims ofgeneral education, laws arenot
stated andthen verified; rather, evidence iscollected bythepupil
from hisown investigations andfrom therecords ofothers, and
generalizations aremade after thefactshavebeenaccumulated. Such
treatment encourages the spirit ofinquiry anddevelops reasoning
power.
Each chapter isprovided withanadequate number ofquestions so
thattheteacher cancover theworkbymaking allassignments from
them. This enables theteacher tosave valuable class-room time.
Model solutions aregiven fordifficult problems.

theearly chapters ofthetext.These arereplaced bychemical equa-
tions onlywhen sufficient understanding hasbeen developed and

CHAPTER 1
Chemistry: AScience
Surely toalchemy thisright isdue, that itmaybecompared tothe
husbandman whereof Aesop makes thefable; that,when hedied, told
hissonsthathehad leftuntothem goldburied inhisvineyard;andthey
digged allover theground, andgoldtheyfound none; butbyreason of
their stirring anddigging themould about theroots oftheir vines, they
hadagreat vintage theyear following: soassuredly thesearch and stir
tomake goldhathbrought tolight agreatnumber ofgoodand fruitful
inventions andexperiments.
Francis Bacon
Theageofalchemy. AstheArabs spread their control over the
Mediterranean world, they carried withthemmuch oftheknowledge
theyhadacquired from theEgyptians andGreeks. Tothemagical
secret practices oftheEgyptians they applied theword alchemy
(Egypt, khemet, dark, black), from which theword chemistry was
derived later.
Among other things, these early alchemists knewhow toprepare
drugs, todye cloth, tomake soapand glass, and toextract metals
from their ores.TheEuropean alchemists, however, soon turned
their attention toaproblem thatwas toconcern them forfifteen
centuries. Itwasthought that metals grew likeplants and, like
living things, could become ill.Goldwasconsidered tobetheonly
“well” metal, andbaser metals were believed tobegold invarious
stages of“sickness”. Therefore, thealchemists reasoned that, ifthe
growing methods ofmetals could bediscovered andthe“sick” metals
made well, gold could bemade fromany ofthebaser metals. This
transmutation wastobebrought about bythediscovery ofasubstance,
commonly referred toasthe“philosopher’s stone”, which when added
toabaser metal would change itinto gold.Asonegeneration suc-
ceeded another, new properties were assigned tothismythical sub-
stance bymeans ofwhich alchemists hoped tobeable toprolong life,

began thescientific method.tochange cowards into heroes, tomake theoldyoung, andeven to
revive thedead. Inattempts toreach thisunattainable goal, alchemists
worked longhours insmall dingy
rooms heating, mixing, dissolving,
distilling andtreating materials by
everyknown method including the
sing-song chant ofincantations.
Many alchemists were sponsor-
edbykings andnobles who long-
edforthepower goldwould bring.
These alchemists were both feared
and respected bytheir supersti-
tious patrons who lacked know-
ledge ofwhat concoctions might
bebrewing inthose steaming cal-
drons.
The alchemists alsosought to
discover a“universal solvent”
(the alkahest), butgave little
thought tothequestion ofacon-
tainer forsuch aunique liquid.
Inthelatter part ofthesixteenth century, alchemy became allied
with medicine when thealchemists came under theinfluence ofthe
Swiss physician Paracelsus who
declared alchemy’s true purpose
was thepreparation ofmedicines
rather than themaking ofgold.
Giving uptheir search forthe
philosopher’s stone, thealchemists
directed their efforts tocontrol
ofthe terrible plagues exacting a
heavy death tollandsought an
elixer vitae (elixir oflife)which
would cure alldiseases. Paracel-
susstudied theproperties ofsub-
stances and began ascientific
investigation that laidthefounda-
tion forthework ofthegreat
chemists oftheseventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.

The greatnames ofearly chemistry. Modern chemistry may be
said tohavebegun about themiddle oftheseventeenth century when
thesearch formythical substances came toaclose, butmany years
passed before the“new” science wasputonasound footing. Near the
endofthecentury, Robert Boyle introduced amethod ofstudy that
hasbeen closely followed ever since. Hiswasthemethod ofexperiment
whereby experimental facts, established bycareful observations,
became thebases forconclusions. Using Boyle’s inductive method,
suchmen asPriestley, Cavendish, Scheele, Lavoisier, andDalton
classified theknowledge ofthealchemists and laidthefoundations
forchemistry asatrue science.

ence forancient traditions, andobstructed bypopular superstition
and fear, thesemenandothers likethem refused tobediscouraged.

Today, thesimplest and most

CHAPTER 2
Physical andChemical Changes
Most ofthesubstances belonging toourglobe areconstantly under-
going alterations insensible qualities, andonevariety becomes, asit
were, transformed into another. Such changes, whether natural or
artificial, slowly orrapidly performed, arecalled chemical.
SirHumphry Davy
Matter and itsstates. Anything thatoccupies space orhasweight
ismatter. This includes notonly solidand liquid substances such as
wood andwater, which canbeseenandtouched, butalsovarious
invisible gases such asairandcarbon dioxide. Toname allthesub-
stances intheworld would beimpossible butasimple classification
canbeattempted. Matter exists inoneofthree physical states: solid,
liquid, orgas.Asolid isrigidandhasdefinite volume andshape.A
liquid flows, hasdefinite volume butnodefinite shape, andassumes
theshape ofthecontaining vessel inwhich itrests inasfarasitfills it.
Agashasneither definite volume nordefinite shape.Agasalways
tends toexpand soasto fillentirely anyvessel inwhich itisplaced.
Changes instate. Itispossible tochange asubstance from one
state toanother bychanging theconditions under which itismain-
tained. These transformations areoften brought about bychanges in
temperature andpressure. Many substances occur inanyorallofthe
three states mentioned, theparticular state being dependent onthe
temperature and pressure conditions. Water atitsfreezing point
changes toiceonafurther removal ofheat.Water attheboiling point
changes tosteam ontheapplication ofmore heat. Conversely, solid
ice,when subjected toheat,becomes aliquid and issaid tomelt. If
heatberemoved fromsteam that isattheboiling point, thesteam
condenses intowater. Most substances canexist inallthree states if
either temperature orpressure, orboth, areappropriately altered.
Under ordinary conditions, airisagas,but ifadequately cooled and
subjected tosufficient pressure itbecomes aliquid oreven asolid.
When asolid istransformed toaliquid, thechange iscalled melting,
orfusion. When aliquid istransformed toasolid, thechange iscalled
freezing, orsolidification. Liquids mayvaporize togases intwoways,
9
10 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
evaporation and boiling, either process being referred toasvapor-
ization. Thetermvapour isused torefer tothegaseous state ofany
substance which normally exists asaliquid. Water, exposed toairat
anytemperature, evaporates atitssurface andsodissolves inthe air.
The action whereby steam isformed throughout anentire mass of
water isboiling andthetemperature atwhich thischange occurs is

called theboiling point.When agaseous substance, through lossof
heat, changes toaliquid, theprocess iscalled condensation. Atbelow
freezing temperatures, snowmay sublime directly into the air
without experiencing anyintervening state. Conversely, water vapour
intheairmaysublime orsolidify directly tofrost orsnow. Such a
direct change from solid togas,orfrom gastosolid, orboth, iscalled
sublimation.
Theaccompanying diagram shows therelationship ofthese changes
inthestates ofmatter. Itshould benoted thattheonlychanges shown
havebeenchanges ofstate.None ofthese transformations have pro-
duced anynewsubstances.
Properties ofmatter. Because notwofingerprints areidentical, the
expert, through study andasystem ofclassification, canidentify any
single print. Since thechemist deals withmany kinds ofmatter, he
musthavesomemethod ofidentifying andclassifying each. Chemists
usetheword properties toindicate thecharacteristics orqualities of
amaterial whereby theycanidentify itanddetermine itsuses.As
with people and fingerprints, notwochemical substances have ident-
icalproperties.
Physical properties. Indealing with thesubject ofchemistry, ex-
pressions such asphysical properties andphysical change will fre-
quently occur.Ageologist, studying theremains ofbygone eras, finds
theremains ofanimals andplants inrocks and iscompelled tobring
tohisstudy ofgeology some knowledge ofzoology andbotany.
PHYSICAL ANDCHEMICAL CHANGES ii
Similarly, many facts belonging totherealm ofphysics, areessential
tothestudy ofchemistry. Such characteristics asstate, odour, taste,
lustre, solubility inwater orother solvents, density, hardness, mallea-
bility, ductility, melting point, boiling point, andanyother character-
istics used intheidentification ofasubstance areknown asphysical
properties.
Achemist, examining anyspecimen ofpure ironunder ordinary
conditions, finds that itisalways agrey solid with abright lustre,
that itsspecific gravity is785,that itmelts at1530°C., that ithas
toughness, malleability, ductility, canbemagnetized, etc.These are
some ofthephysical properties ofironthat collectively help todis-
tinguish itfromanyother substance.
Physical change. Ifaniron ball isconverted intoapileoffilings, the
resultant change isoneofform only. Iftheiron ball ismelted, the
change isstilloneofstate only. Ineach instance, thechange ofform in
noway affects theoriginal properties ofthesubstance, which remains
iron.
Similarly, thesawing ofwood, thebreaking orbending ofglass, the
crushing ofrocks, themagnetization ofiron, theformation ofdew,
andtheheating ofplatinum wire, areexamples ofalterations whereby
thematerials concerned losenone ofthecharacteristics bywhich they
areidentified. They remain substantially thesame throughout al-
though their physical properties maybetemporarily altered.
Anychange intheoriginal substance thatdoes notresult inthepro-
duction ofanewsubstance iscalled aphysical change.
Chemical properties. Thechemical properties ofasubstance canbe
determined byobserving itsaction, orlack ofaction, when itisplaced
incontact with other substances. Chemical properties alsoinclude the
behaviour ofasubstance when itisheated, orexposed tolight, or
decomposed bythepassage ofanelectric current. Thus, whenwestate
thathydrogen burns, orthatoxygen supports combustion, weare
referring tochemical properties ofthesetwogases.
Chemical change. When achemical change occurs inasubstance,
thesubstance loses itsidentity. Thenewsubstance orsubstances
resulting from thechange have different physical andchemical proper-
ties,aswellasadifferent energy content, from theoriginal material.
Achemical change isusually accompanied byachange intempera-
ture.
Therusting ofiron, theburning ofcoal, thecreation ofstarch and
sugar bygreen plants, thedigestion offood,andthedecomposition of
water intooxygen andhydrogen bymeans ofthepassage ofanelectric
current, areexamples offamiliar changes. Itisquite evident thatthe
12 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
products ofthese processes possess properties totally different from
those oftheoriginal materials. Thus, when apiece ofcoalburns, the
resulting ashandgases have different properties from theoriginal
coal,andlack theenergy content ofthecoal inthat neither ofthe
newly formed products canbeburned togive heat.
Anychange intheoriginal substance that results intheproduction of
anewsubstance orsubstances with properties totally different from the
original iscalled achemical change.
Inthefollowing chapters, scores ofadditional examples ofchemical
changes willbeencountered.

CHAPTER 3
The Scientific Method
Phlogiston died asanoldking—once infinitely dominant, somewhat
tyrannical, notalways just;nowdeposed, decrepit, utterly senile, for-
saken byall.
W.Odling
Thephlogiston theory. Manhasalways been curious about fire,and
itisnotsurprising that theearly chemists attempted toexplain the
nature ofburning orcombustion. In1669, Johann Becher wrote a
book inwhich hetried toanswer thequestion, “What really happens
when asubstance burns?” Becher putforward atheory that all
combustible materials contained
a“fatty earth” hecalled terra
pinguis andthat,when burning
took place, the terra pinguis es-
caped with theflame.
George Ernst Stahl (1660-
1734), apupil ofBecher, de-
veloped histeacher’s views and
advanced atheory that lasted
formore than acentury. Stahl
dropped thename terra pinguis
andpropounded thetheory that
asubstance phlogiston (from a
Greek word meaning fire-stuff)
waspresent inallcombustible
substances, and that phlogis-
tonescaped when asubstance
burned. Exceedingly combus-
tible substances were believed
tocontain much phlogiston, but
theashremaining after com-
bustion contained nophlogiston
andhence would notburn.
14 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Incombustible substances contained nophlogiston. Thephlogiston
theory was sostrongly advocated bysuch eighteenth century
chemists asCavendish, Priestley, and Scheele that itbecame
thoroughly established.
Stahl, however, hadadvanced atheory without paying dueregard
toallthefacts, andwithout having made actual measurements. His
theory hadtwofaults: first,noonehadever seen, caught, orweighed
phlogiston freefrom thesubstances supposed tocontain it;second,
noonehadeverexamined the airtodiscover what changes had
occurred initduring theburning process. Inother words, Stahl
brought forward noexperimental proof ofhistheory. Later itwas
discovered thattheweight oftheresidue leftafter ametal burned was
greater than theweight ofthemetal before burning. This discovery
could notbeexplained onthebasis ofthephlogiston theory because
thelossofphlogiston should have resulted inadecrease inweight.
Stahl’s followers attempted toexplain thisdiscrepancy bysaying that
phlogiston possessed aso-called “negative weight” that decreased
theweight ofanysubstance containing it.
The phlogiston theory ofcombustion wasonly rejected when
scientists learned tostudy
facts firstandformulate
their theories afterwards.
Themodern theory of
combustion. One ofthe
greatest ofthephlogiston-
istswasJoseph Priestley,
anEnglish preacher, who
studied chemistry asa
hobby. Hewasagreat ex-
perimenter andwascon-
stantly heating substances
inattempts toproduce
newgases which hecalled
“airs”. Asasource ofheat,
Priestley frequently useda
lens toconcentrate the
rays ofthesunonthe
materials being heated.
The gases produced were
collected inbottles ina
pneumatic trough, oneof
Priestley’s inventions. Con-Fisher Scientific Company

aSwedish chemist, wasprobably the first che-
mist toprepare pure oxygen. Hediscovered a
great number ofnew substances including
chlorine.

cerning one ofhisexperiments hewrote: “Iproceeded with great
alacrity toexamine bythehelp ofit(alens)what kind of‘air’a
great variety ofsubstances, natural and fictitious, would yield, put-
tingthem into vessels filled with quicksilver (mercury) kept inverted
inabasin ofthesame” (Fig. 3.1).
In1774, while heating oneofthese substances, redcalx, or“mer-
curius calcinatus perse”(mercuric oxide), Priestley discovered agas
wenowknow asoxygen. Heerroneously believed that thisnewgas
wastheoneintheatmosphere withwhich phlogiston combined when
itescaped from aburning substance. Hetherefore called it“dephlo-
gisticated air”,meaning agasdevoid ofphlogiston. Because Priestley
wassosurethatsomething wasgiven offduring theburning process,
hemissed thereal significance ofthisdiscovery duetoinadequate
investigation ofhisfindings.
Itremained forafamous Frenchman, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier
(1743-1794), toadvance anewtheory ofcombustion. Hewasthe first

JohnMayow, anEnglish physician, haddiscovered that therewasa
diminution involume oftheairresulting frombreathing andburning.
About 1770, Karl Scheele hadshown that theactive part oftheair
could beremoved bytherusting ofiron, thesmouldering ofphos-
phorus, andother methods.
In1774, Lavoisier weighed asealed glass flask containing tinand
air.Heheated this forseveral daysandfound thatawhite powder
hadformed onthetinbutthat theflaskand itscontents hadnot
changed inweight. Hethenmade ahole intheflaskandonre-weighing
theflaskand itscontents hefound that theweight hadincreased.
Further investigation showed that this increase inweight wasthe

CHAPTER 4
Oxygen: TheMostAbundant Element
Onthe1stofAugust, 1774, Iendeavoured toextract airfrom mer-
curius calcinatus per se,and Ipresently found that,bymeans ofalens,
airwasexpelled from itvery readily. Having gotabout three orfour
times asmuch asthebulk ofmymaterials, Iadmitted water toitand
found that itwasnotimbibed by it.Butwhat surprised memore
than Icanwellexpress wasthat acandle burned inthis airwith a
remarkable brilliant flame.
Joseph Priestley
Oxygen wasprobably firstprepared bytheSwedish chemist, Karl
Scheele, whodecomposed nitric acidvapour, aswellassaltpetre, by
theapplication ofheat. Scheele didnotpublish hisresults, sothe
credit forfirstpreparation isusually given toPriestley whose method
ofpreparation andcollection hasalready been described. Inaddition
totheexperiments mentioned at
thebeginning ofthis chapter,
Priestley studied the effects of
oxygen, firstonmiceand lateron
himself, andwas impressed by
theexhilarating effects produced.
“Who can tell,” hewrote, “but
that intime thispure airmay
become afashionable article in
luxury? Hitherto, only mice and
myself have hadtheprivilege of
breathing it.”
Thestudy ofoxygen isofmajor
importance toboth theprofessional
chemist andthebeginner. Thisim-
portance depends upon anumber
ofthings, chief ofwhich isthe
abundance oftheelement itself;
thelargenumber ofcompounds ofwhich itforms apart;andthefact
that thediscovery ofthiselement marked thebeginning ofmodern
chemistry.
Occurrence. Oxygen isthemostabundant oftheearth’s elements.
Byweight itmakes upnearly halfourglobe, including earth, ocean,

three-fifths oxygen byweight, and allanimal andplant bodies contain
averyhighpercentage ofthiselement. Oxygen alsoplays animportant
part inthemanufacture ofsynthetic products.
Preparation. Because oxygen issoplentiful, itmight beassumed
that itwould beasimple matter toselect one, oramixture, ofits
many compounds asasource forpreparing itinapure form. In
making such achoice, three important factors should beconsidered.
Isthematerial cheap? Has itahigh percentage ofoxygen? Does it
readily yield itsoxygen? Air,sand, mercuric oxide, andpotassium
chlorate might beconsidered. Air ischeap and plentiful, butthe
separation ofoxygen from theother gases withwhich itismixed inair
isadifficult matter requiring expensive equipment (p.37).Sand is
very rich inoxygen, butcannot bepersuaded topartwith iteven
when heated toextremely high temperatures. When mercuric oxide
isheated inahard-glass test-tube andthegasproduced istested with
aglowing splint, thesplint promptly bursts intoafulland brilliant
flame, andmercury, intheform ofsilvery beads, gathers onthesides
ofthetube.Butmercuric oxide isexpensive, hasalowpercentage of
oxygen, andtherefore isnotasuitable source ofoxygen. However,
thesimplicity ofthechemical change involved may wellattract our
22 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
attention. This change canberepresented bythefollowing word
equation:
Mercuric oxide >Mercury +Oxygen
Potassium chlorate ismuch cheaper than mercuric oxide, andwhen
heated yields agreater proportion ofoxygen. This substance iscon-
venient, inexpensive, andsuitable forpreparing oxygen insufficient
volume forlaboratory study. Potassium chlorate isawhite solid
composed ofthree elements, potassium, chlorine, andoxygen. If
crystals ofitareplaced inahard -glass test-tube andheated, they
release oxygen rather reluctantly, andonly afterbeing strongly heated.
Thepotassium chlorate firstcrackles loudly, ordecrepitates, then it
melts. Finally, vigorous bubbling occurs inthemolten liquid.Aglowing
splint testindicates that theescaping gas isoxygen. Astheheating
process iscontinued, itisnoticed thatthebubbles finally stopforming
andsuddenly themolten mass becomes andremains awhite solid.
This solidhasdifferent properties from theoriginal potassium chlorate
and iscalled potassium chloride.
Thechemical change occurring canberepresented bythefollowing
equation:

forthesame length oftime, oxygen willultimately begiven offby
both tubes. Thetube containing themanganese dioxide, however,
bubbles more briskly than thetube withpotassium chlorate only.A
glowing splint testonboth tubes indicates thatoxygen isbeing pro-
duced atamuch faster rate inthetubecontaining themixture.
Iftheresidue from thetubewhich contained themixture ofmanga-
nese dioxide andpotassium chlorate isnowthoroughly washed with
boiling water, filtered, anddried, ablack residue, resembling manga-
nese dioxide, remains onthe filter paper.When thisresidue isadded
toafresh quantity ofmelted potassium chlorate, itactsexactly asdid

Thus themanganese dioxide caused thepotassium chlorate toyield its

reaction arecalled positive catalysts;those that retard therate are
called negative catalysts.
Laboratory preparation ofoxygen. Ifamixture ofpotassium chlorate
andmanganese dioxide isheated inahard -glass test-tube (Fig. 4.4),
theoxygen canbecollected easily bythedownward displacement of
water. Several bottles ofthegasthus collected canbeused tostudy
theproperties ofoxygen. Priestley’s experiments with gases which he
called “airs” resulted inhisinvention ofthewell-known pneumatic
trough, essentially thesame asthat inusetoday.
Fig. 4.5. Three methods ofcollecting agas. A,downward displacement of
water. B,upward displacement ofair. C,downward displacement ofair.
Some additional methods ofpreparation. Oxygen canbeliberated
fromsome ofitscompounds without being heated. Ifwater isadded
tosodium peroxide, oxygen isliberated very rapidly. Acommercial
product called “oxone” isessentially sodium peroxide and issold for
useinaspecial generator. Oxygen canbeprepared fromwater bythe
useofelectrical energy, butthechiefcommercial source isliquid air.
Physical properties. Asmight bededuced from itspresence inthe
atmosphere, oxygen isacolorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. Itis
slightly soluble inwater, about 3volumes dissolving in100volumes of
water atroom temperature, andnearly 5volumes in100volumes of
icewater. Hence, coldwater saturated with oxygen willgive off
bubbles ofoxygen ifallowed tostand inawarm room. Oxygen is
1*105times asdense asair.Itcanbeliquefied bycooling to—119° C.
under apressure of50atmospheres. Liquid oxygen hasaslightly
bluish colour and boils at—182-97° C.atatmospheric pressure.
When cooled to—218-4° C., itfreezes toapale-blue snow-like solid.
Chemical properties. Because oxygen occurs insomany substances,
itmight beconcluded that itisavery active element. When exposed
foralongtime toair,iron rusts, wood rots,animal remains decay,
andmany other similar changes, resulting from theslow action of
OXYGEN: THEMOSTABUNDANT ELEMENT 25
oxygen, take place.Afreshly-scraped piece ofironsoonbecomes dull
andtarnished. Theoxygen oftheairslowly unites with theiron to
form anewsubstance called ironoxide (ferric oxide). Similarly, the
oxygen intheairwebreathe slowly reacts with digested food toform
carbon dioxide and torelease theenergy necessary toactivate and
keep thebodywarm. Theprocess bywhich oxygen combines with
some other substance iscalled oxidation. When this action isslow
andwithout perceptible heat, aswhen iron rusts, itiscalled slow
oxidation. When rapid oxidation occurs, e.g.,when wood burns,
noticeable heatand light areproduced, andtheprocess ofburning is
known ascombustion. Although oxygen supports combustion, itdoes
not itself burn.
Combustion. Theterm combustion, although mostcommonly used
with reference tooxygen, sometimes includes chemical reactions in
which oxygen isnotinvolved (e.g.
hydrogen andantimony willburn
inchlorine gasandproduce heat
and light) .Combustion isanychem-
icalreaction inwhich noticeable heat
and light areproduced. Itshould
benoted thatalthough heat ispro-
duced during slow oxidation, itis
given offsoslowly itcannot be
easily detected. Allchemical re-
actions thatgive offheat arecalled
exothermic reactions; hence all
oxidations areexothermic.
Reactions thatabsorb heat are
called endothermic reactions. For
example, the decomposition of
mercuric oxide intomercury and
oxygen requires heat; ifthesupply ofheat isinterrupted, thereaction
ceases. Hence thisreaction isendothermic.
Kindling temperatures. Some substances, apparently inactive with
oxygen atordinary temperatures, become quite active athigher
temperatures. Wood, sulphur, coal,andother substances combine
slowly withoxygen atordinary temperatures, butthereaction may
besoslow thatonly careful study overalongperiod oftime indicates
anyperceptible change. If,however, thetemperature israised, the
speed ofthereaction increases and finally actual combustion may
begin.
Theoxidation ofphosphorus, anexothermic reaction, occurs soFig. 4.6.Combustion inoxygen

tingoxide isshaken with water and
thesolution tested withanindicator.

rapidly even atroom temperature that itislikely toignite “spontane-
ously”. Sulphur must beheated toahigher temperature than phos-
phorus, and coal toastillhigher temperature before combustion
begins. The lowest temperature atwhich amaterial will ignite, or
start burning, iscalled itsignition orkindling temperature. Instarting
acoal fire,weapply ourknowledge ofkindling temperatures byso
arranging thepaper, shavings, and larger pieces ofwood and coal
that, aseach material ignites, thenext inorder israised toatempera-
ture atwhich rapid oxidation occurs.
Spontaneous combustion. Ifasmall piece ofyellow phosphorus is
dissolved incarbon disulphide andthesolution poured onapiece of
filter paper andexposed toair,thecarbon disulphide evaporates
rapidly andminute pieces ofphosphorus areleftonthepaper. Slow
oxidation occurs inthefinely-divided pieces ofphosphorus sorapidly
that thephosphorus ignites inabout twominutes. Whenever asub-
stance undergoing slow oxidation does notreadily conduct heat,
orwhen thematerial issoenclosed that freecirculation ofairaround

Atest foroxygen. Todistinguish onesubstance from allother
substances, chemists make useofcertain characteristic properties.
Forexample, carbon dioxide istheonly gasthat willturnlimewa^er

oxygen. However, nitrous oxide, agascommonly usedbydentists as
ananaesthetic (p.255), willalsorekindle aglowing splint. Conse-
quently, aglowing splint ismerely an“indication” ofoxygen anda
“conclusive test” ismade byadding thegastoawater solution of
pyrogallic acidandpotassium hydroxide. Oxygen dissolves readily
inthismixture, andatthesame time turns thecolorless solution toa
deepbrown colour. Noother gaswillbehave inasimilar manner.
Oxides. Sulphur, carbon, phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, calcium,
andironburn vigorously inpureoxygen. Whenever oxygen combines
1Acetylene

with another element, theresultant compound iscalled anoxide.
Oxides occur asgases, liquids, and solids.When thegasproduced from
burning sulphur, sulphur dioxide, isshaken with asmallamount of
water, theresulting solution turns blue litmus red; renders pink
phenolphthalein colorless; andchanges neutral (green) bromthymol
blue solution toyellow. When magnesium isburned inoxygen, the
product ofthecombustion isawhite solid called magnesium oxide.
When this isshaken inwater, itpartially dissolves, forming asolution
thatturns redlitmus blue; colorless phenolphthalein pink orred;and
thegreen, neutral solution ofbromthymol blue toablue colour. Sub-
stances likelitmus, phenolphthalein andbromthymol blue areknown
asindicators because they indicate whether asolution towhich they
areadded isanacidorabase.
Bytheuseofindicators, most oxides canbedivided intotwoclasses.
Oxides ofnon-metals such assulphur dioxide andcarbon dioxide that
combine with water toform acids arecalled acidic oxides oracid
anhydrides. Oxides ofmetals such assodium oxide andmagnesium
oxide, thatcombine withwater toform bases arecalled basic oxides
orbasic anhydrides. Other oxides, e.g.copper oxide, thatdonotreact
withwater arecalled neutral oxides. When magnesium oxide isshaken

Nitrogen andtheAtmosphere
The gas, nitrogen, serves asablanket tokeep theworld from
burning upintheoxygen oftheatmosphere ..[ifthenitrogen oftheair
were replaced byoxygen] ...The slightest firecould start agreatand
overwhelming conflagration. Asingle torch might commence thecon-
flagration oftheworld.
Hollis Godfrey
In1772, Dr.Rutherford oftheUniversity ofEdinburgh demon-
strated that ifliving animals were permitted tobreathe within a
confined volume ofair,therewasultimately leftonlyaninertand
peculiar gas.Thishecalled “phlogisticated air”.About thesame time,
Priestley showed that after charcoal wasburned inaconfined volume
ofair,thegaseous material remaining was also phlogisticated air.
Scheele firstclearly pointed outthat airisamixture oftwogases that
hecalled active airandinactive air.Lavoisier recognized that inactive
airwasanelement andnamed itazotefrom aGreek word meaning
“without life”. Later (1823), thename nitrogen wassuggested because
thiselement wasfound tobeaconstituent ofnitre orsaltpetre.
NITROGEN
Occurrence. About78% ofatmospheric air isfreenitrogen. The
presence ofsuch alargeamount dilutes theoxygen andslowsdown
oxidation. Without this dilution, thecombustion offuels could not
becontrolled andmost metals would corrode sorapidly that their use
would beimpracticable.
Nitrogen alsooccurs incombination innature. Small amounts of
potassium nitrate arepresent inmost soilsandthere isahuge deposit
ofsodium nitrate inChileandPeru. Nitrogen isalsoaconstituent of
many vegetable andanimal substances.
Preparation. 1.Atmospheric nitrogen. Nitrogen isprepared from air
bytheremoval ofoxygen. Thiswithdrawal iseffected intwoways:
onemethod takes advantage oftheaffinity various substances have
foroxygen, andtheother utilizes thedifferences inboiling points of
thevarious components ofliquid air.

Chemical. Nitrogen neither burns norsupports combustion. Awater
solution hasnoeffect onlitmus. The chief characteristic ofnitrogen
isitsinertness, but itdoes react withsome ofthemost active metals

high temperatures (p.252), andwithhydrogen under special con-
ditions (p.249).

THEATMOSPHERE
Theterm atmosphere isgiven tothemixture ofgases that sur-
rounds theearth. Until recent times itwasthought that theatmos-
phere wasabout onehundred miles high, butwith thediscovery of
radar, Geiger counters, andV-2rockets wearelearning that this
“ocean ofair” isovertwothousand miles deepandofgreat complexity.
Theatmosphere consists ofthree shells. Thelower troposphere isabout
tenmiles deep; thestratosphere extends from thetopofthetropos-
phere toaheight ofapproximately fifty miles, andtheionosphere
rises toaheight ofmore thantwothousand miles. Thetroposphere,
although consisting oflessthan one-third of1%ofthetotalvolume
oftheatmosphere accounts formore than79% ofthetotalmass ofair.
The following account refers tothecharacteristics ofairnear the
earth’s surface, i.e.inthelower level ofthetroposphere.

andareused toexplore theupper atmosphere. They have reached heights in
excess ofninety miles.
Properties. Air isamixture ofvarious gases andassuch exhibits
theproperties ofeachcomponent. At0°C.and760mm. pressure a
litre ofairweighs 1*29grams. Because ofitsgreat height, theatmos-
phere exerts aconsiderable pressure atsealevel (Chapter 10).This
pressure decreases from 760mm. atsealevel toabout 40mm. atten
milesandabout0Tmm. atthirty miles.
Composition. The principal components ofairarethetwogases,
oxygen andnitrogen. Oxygen makes upapproximately one-fifth, and
nitrogen four-fifths, ofthewhole. Inaddition tothese principal sub-
stances, however, certain others arealways present. Thepercentages
ofthevarious components vary with thealtitude. The following
tableshows theaverage composition byvolume ofdryairatsealevel.
Theproportions ofoxygen andcarbon dioxide inagiven locality
may fluctuate because ofvariations inrespiration, combustion, and

Water vapour anddust arealways present inairandaretheonly
substances varying widely inpercentages. The percentages ofthe
components ofairintheabove table aredetermined ontheassumption
thattheairisabsolutely dry,and this isacondition never found in
nature.
LIQUID AIR
Airwas firstprepared intheliquid state in1877. Liquid air,however,
could notbeproduced inlarge quantities until 1901when aCanadian,
E.A.LeSueur, perfected anapparatus atSault Ste.Marie forsuch
production. Today themanufacture ofliquid air isanimportant
industry, and iscarried oninnearly every large industrial centre.
Preparation. After water vapour andcarbon dioxide areremoved
from air, itiscompressed under apressure ofabout 100atmospheres,
i.e.,ofabout 1500 lb.persq.inch.Theheatproduced bythiscom-
pression raises thetemperature ofthe air.This heat isremoved by
coldwater circulating through acoiled pipe inacondenser. Thecold
compressed airthen goes toaliquefier consisting ofalong, coiled
copper tube.Aneedle valve atthelower endofthetube allows the
airtoexpand rapidly. This expansion further cools theairthat is
returned tothecompressor andtheprocess isrepeated. Each quantity
ofairescaping from thevalve iscolder than itspredecessor until
eventually theairiscooled below itsliquefaction temperature, when
itcondenses.
Properties. Liquid air isapale-blue liquid with adensity slightly
lessthan that ofwater. The boiling point varies between —195°C.
and—185°C.Liquid air iskept insulated from external heat in
double-walled flasks resembling thermos bottles (Dewar flasks). Since
liquid air isextremely cold,many interesting experiments canbe
performed with it.Apiece ofrubber tubing, when immersed inliquid
38 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
air,becomes asbrittle asglass; flowers, vegetables, and fruits become
sohardandbrittle thatthey shatter topieces ifdropped;andmercury
isfrozen hardenough tobeused asahammer todrive nails.
Uses. Liquid airisused asasource ofoxygen, nitrogen, argon, and
neon. Because liquid airisamixture andnotacompound (Chapter 9),
thevarious liquid components boil offatdifferent temperatures. Kept
inanopen vessel, itbecomes richer inoxygen because nitrogen boils
atalower temperature thanoxygen. Thevarious components ofliquid
airareseparated byusing afractionating column notunlike thatused
fordistilling petroleum.
INERT GASES
Anaccount ofthediscovery andinvestigation oftheinert gases in
theatmosphere reads something likeadetective story. In1892,
Lord Rayleigh showed thatalitre ofnitrogen prepared byremoving
oxygen from airweighs 1-2572 gm.,whereas alitreofnitrogen prepared
chemically weighs 1-2506 gm.This indicated thatwhen nitrogen was
prepared from theatmosphere some substance denser than nitrogen
remained. Theproblem thenwas toseparate nitrogen from theun-
known gas.Several methods ofremoving nitrogen from samples of
“atmospheric nitrogen” were developed byLord Rayleigh and Sir
William Ramsay. Inoneofthese experiments, atmospheric nitrogen
waspassed overheated magnesium thatcombined with thenitrogen.
Asmallvolume ofgasremained and thiswould notcombine with the
NITROGEN ANDTHEATMOSPHERE 39
magnesium. Theexperimenters were unable tomake thisgasenter
intochemical combination withanyother substance, sotheygave
itthename argon, meaning inactive. Later, suspecting impurities in
thisgas,theymade efforts topurify it.Thegaswasliquefied byusing
liquid airasacooling agent.
When this liquid was vaporized
and fractionated, itwasfound to
contain minute amounts offour
other inert gases. Three ofthese
gases werenewelements andwere
named neon (new), xenon (astran-
ger), andkrypton (hidden). The
fourth gas,helium, hadbeen dis-
covered previously.
Argon. Argon wasthe first ofthe
inert gases found intheatmosphere.
Itconstitutes about 0-94% byvol-
ume oftheairand isproduced from
liquid airbyfractionation. Itis
more efficient than nitrogen in
gas-filled tungsten-filament electric
lamps.
Neon. Neon, alsoproduced from
liquid air, isused inmaking “neon”
advertising signs.When placed un-
derlowpressure inaglass tube
andsubjected toahigh tension
electrical discharge, neon produces
abright-red glow. Mixed with other gases invariously coloured glass
tubes, neon produces many attractive contrasting colour effects (e.g.
neonandmercury vapour inayellow tube givebright green).
Helium. Thename “helium” isderived from theGreek helios (the
sun), because theelement was firstdetected intheatmosphere ofthe
sun.When aspectroscope wastrained onthesunduring aneclipse in
1868, abright yellow linewasobserved inthespectrum. Nosubstance
previously discovered ontheearth showed thissame line inthe
spectrum. In1895,Ramsay isolated agasfromanoreofuranium and
inthespectrum ofthisgashefound alinecorresponding tothat
observed in1868andgave thename helium tothenew element.
Unlike theother inert gases, helium isnotprepared from air.Natural
gases inTexas, Oklahoma, Ohio,andKansas contain asmuch as2-5%
byvolume ofthiselement, which isnowobtained commercially fromJournal ofChemical Education

these sources. Helium isthesecond lightest substance known and
has92% ofthelifting power ofhydrogen. This quality oflightness,
coupled with itsnon-combustibility, renders itvaluable inlighter-
than-air aircraft. Since helium islesssoluble inblood than nitrogen,
ahelium-oxygen mixture issupplied todeep-sea divers instead of
compressed air.Under pressure, thenitrogen oftheairdissolves in
theblood and,when thepressure isreleased, theescaping nitrogen
blocks thecapillaries, causing serious effects andeven death.
Krypton andxenon. Until, recently krypton andxenon have not
beenproduced insufficient quantities tomake their usepracticable.
Aprocess recently patented inFrance, however, may result ingreater
useofthese raregases inthefuture. Light emitted from high-tension
krypton andxenon tubes isvery rich ininfra-red andultra-violet rays.
Useofthese lamps inradiology andhealth treatments promises tobe
valuable. Tinylamps have been constructed foruseinthecavities of
thehuman bodyandthesemaybeofgreat service inmedical work.

The firstmention ofagasevolved bytheaction ofdilute acids on
certain metals wasmade byParacelsus (1493-1541). Heobserved that
when ironanddilute sulphuric acidinteract “anairarises which bursts
forth likethewind”. Itwasnotuntil 1766 thatanEnglish scientist,
Henry Cavendish, firstobtained hydrogen inapure state, described
itstrue properties, andcharacterized itasadefinite chemical element.
Hecalled thisgas“inflammable air”.Alittle later (1781), heproved
thatwater wastheonly product resulting from thecombustion of
“inflammable air”. Lavoisier (1783) renamed thegashydrogen, a
name derived from theGreek words thatmean “water producer”.
Occurrence. Although uncombined hydrogen iswidely distributed
innature, itisnotsoabundant asoxygen. Mixed with other gases,
freehydrogen ispresent incertain
varieties ofnatural gasand inthe
gases that escape from volcanoes
andpetroleum wells. Mere traces
arepresent inourimmediate at-
mosphere butenormous quantities
exist intheatmosphere ofthesun
and ofmany stars. Themanu-
factured gasused forilluminating
andheating purposes hasahigh
content offreehydrogen.
Combined hydrogen isvery
abundant. Itforms one-ninth (by
weight) ofitsoxide, water. Itis
anessential constituent ofallacids.
Combined with carbon, itforms
thehydrocarbons thatmake up
petroleum and natural gas. In
combination with carbon andoxygen itforms carbohydrates and
fats,which areimportant substances infoods, aswell assuch

Hydrogen isaconstituent ofallliving organisms, andcomprises about
tenpercent ofourbody weight.
Preparation. Likeoxygen, hydrogen isobtained from itscompounds.
Inmost cases, water andcertain dilute acids arethesources, andthe
methods ofpreparation areoffourmain types:

cheap commercial source ofhydrogen.
1.Theaction ofactive metals onwater. Themore active metals such
aspotassium, sodium, andcalcium willdisplace hydrogen from cold
water. Theaction withpotassium andsodium, however, issovigorous
astobeextremely dangerous. This factor, coupled with thehigh cost
ofthese metals, makes themethod unsatisfactory forthecommercial
preparation ofhydrogen.
Potassium andsodium arelighter than water and float onthe
surface. Ifasmall piece ofsodium isdropped upon coldwater, itmelts
intoasilvery globule thatmoves about rapidly onthewater surface,
liberating hydrogen with ahissing sound until itfinally disappears.
Ifthesodium iswrapped inapiece oflead foilpierced withafewholes
andthendropped intowater, theaction proceeds smoothly andthe
gasevolved willdisplace thewater from aninverted test-tube held
over therising bubbles. Thecollected hydrogen willgive itscharacter-
istic“pop” orexplosion when brought near aflame. The slippery
44 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
(soapy) feeling oftheliquid remaining inthedishand itsaction onred
litmus paper indicate thepresence ofabase orhydroxide.
When metallic potassium isdropped onthesurface ofwater, the
action ismuch more violent andsomuch heat isgenerated thatthe
hydrogen evolved isignited andburns; theflame isviolet because of
thepresence ofpotassium vapour. Inthecase ofthesodium, theheat
generated isnotusually sufficient toignite theescaping hydrogen
unless warm water isused ortheglobule isprevented frommoving
about onthesurface ofthewater. Thehydrogen then ignites, and
because ofthepresence ofsodium vapour burns with ayellow flame.
Both experiments aredangerous andaglass plate should always be
placed over thebeaker toprotect theexperimenter’s eyes.
Metallic calcium, which sinks inwater, actsrapidly butnotvio-
lently, andthehydrogen iseasily collected.
Inallthree cases, themetal used frees only halfofthehydrogen in
thewater uponwhich itacts,andcombines with theremaining half
and alloftheoxygen toproduce thehydroxide ofthemetal. The
hydroxides ofpotassium andsodium arereadily soluble intheexcess
water, butcanberecovered aswhite solids byevaporation ofthe
remaining solutions. Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) hasalimited
solubility andmaybeseen insuspended form inthewater after the
action.
The following word equations represent thechemical changes in-
volved :

Less active metals, such asmagnesium and iron,decompose water,
butonly athigher temperatures. Very finely divided magnesium
decomposes coldwater slowly, butreacts more rapidly withsteam.
Magnesium +Water >Magnesium hydroxide +Hydrogen
Iron also will liberate hydrogen from steam. Ifsteam ispassed
through atube containing finely divided red-hot iron, black magnetic
oxide ofiron isformed andhydrogen passes offasagas.Thismethod
isused inthecommercial preparation ofhydrogen (Fig. 6.2).

Themetals above hydrogen intheactivity table (butnone ofthose

chloric acid.The active metals atthetopofthepreceding listreact
violently; metals such astinorlead, listed immediately above hydro-
gen,react soslowly astobeineffective. The lessactive metals, located
46 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
below hydrogen inthe list,donotform hydrogen ifthey interact
with acids.
Themetals mostcommonly used inthelaboratory preparation of
small quantities ofhydrogen arezinc oriron, because theaction,
although rapid atordinary temperatures, isnottooviolent andcan
becontrolled easily.
Asmall handful ofgranulated zinc isplaced intheflask (Fig. 6.3)
anddilute sulphuric acid (orhydrochloric acid) isadded through the
thistle-tube until thelower endofthelatter iscovered. Ifpure zinc is
used, theaction isvery slow, but itcanbeaccelerated byadding some
copper sulphate solution totheacidthrough thethistle-tube. Com-
mercial zinccontains impurities (chiefly carbon), which accelerate the
action without theaddition ofcopper sulphate. Thecopper sulphate
ortheimpurities inthezincactascatalysts. Concentrated sulphuric
acid, adense, oily liquid, willnotproduce hydrogen unless itisdiluted
with water. The dilute acidmaybeprepared byslowly pouring the
concentrated acid into fiveorsixtimes thesame volume ofwater.
This should bedone gradually andwith constant stirring, since a
great deal ofheat isproduced onmixing. Water should never beadded
toconcentrated sulphuric acid (p.206).
Theaction ofthisdilute acidonzincproceeds smoothly, without
heating, because thereaction isexothermic. Hydrogen isdisplaced
from theacidanddrives theairoutoftheflask. Since mixtures of
hydrogen and airexplode violently when ignited, flame should bekept
away from thegenerator. Thegasshould betested forpurity by
collecting itinaninverted test-tube (downward displacement ofair)
andtesting itwith aflame.Amixture explodes when brought tothe
flame, butthepure gasburns quietly. Since hydrogen isonlyvery
slightly soluble inwater, itmaybecollected bythedisplacement of
water once successive tests indicate thatthepuregas isbeing evolved.
Because thegas islighter than air,the filled bottles should bekept
inaninverted position.
The“word equation” fortheinteraction ofthezincandacidshows
theproduction ofacompound called zincsulphate. Themetal replaces
thehydrogen oftheacid, liberating itasagas,andforms asoluble
saltthatremains dissolved intheexcess water inthegenerator. Ifthe
solution isevaporated, transparent crystals ofzincsulphate are left.
The “activity table”, discussed earlier, shows thatanyone of
several metals might have been used instead ofzinc. Magnesium
and iron react vigorously with dilute sulphuric acid, producing
hydrogen andasoluble saltofthemetal ineach case. Certain dilute

Carbon+Steam—>Carbon monoxide +Hydrogen
Themixture ofthese twogases iscalled “water gas”, and itisof
great importance asanindustrial fuel (p.189). This “water gas” is
one ofthecheapest sources ofindustrial hydrogen, although the
process ofseparating thetwogases isacomplicated one.
4.Electrolysis ofwater.When adirect current ofelectricity ispassed
through water containing asmallamount ofsulphuric acid, thewater
isbroken down intothegases, hydrogen andoxygen, intheratio of
twovolumes ofhydrogen toonevolume ofoxygen. Where there is
cheap electricity, this isanother commercial method ofpreparing
hydrogen, thedetails ofwhich arediscussed inthenext chapter.
Physical properties. Hydrogen isacolorless gasthat, inpure form,
istasteless andodorless. When commercial zincandanacidareused
initspreparation, theresultant gashasadistinct odour because of
thepresence ofimpurities which maybeeliminated bypassing the
gasthrough solutions ofsodium hydroxide andpotassium permanga-
nate.Hydrogen isonly slightly soluble inwater, lessthan 2volumes
ofthegasdissolving in100volumes ofwater at20°C.Itisalsothe
lightest known gas.One litre ofpurehydrogen (measured at0°C.and
760mm. pressure) weighs only0-08987 gm.(usually written 0-09gm.),
whereas one litre ofairunder thesame conditions weighs 1-293 gm.
Hydrogen isbutone-sixteenth asdense asoxygen.
Hydrogen canbeliquefied onlywith thegreatest difficulty. Liquid
hydrogen iscolorless and boils at—253° C.When part oftheliquid
isallowed toevaporate rapidly, theremainder freezes toanice-like
solid, melting at—258° C.Exempting helium, allknown gases solidify
easily when placed inavessel surrounded byliquid hydrogen.
Chemical properties. Pure hydrogen burns quietly inairwith a
pale-blue, almost colorless flame, but itisdangerously explosive if
mixed with airoroxygen before ignition. Water istheonlyproduct
ofitscombustion. The filmofmoisture often noticeable onthebottom
ofavesselwhen firstplaced overaBunsen flame oralighted gasrange,
HYDROGEN: LIGHTEST OFALLELEMENTS 49
iscaused bythewater produced when thehydrogen andhydrogen
compounds intheilluminating gasburn.
One ofthestrangest truths ofchemistry isillustrated bymaking
useofachemical property ofhydrogen. Hydrogen, ahighly inflam-
mable gas,combines withoxygen, which supports combustion, toform
water used toextinguish fire.Hydrogen, generated inaflask, is
dried bypassing itthrough aU-tube containing lumps ofcalcium

chloride, asubstance that readily absorbs moisture. When the air,
originally present intheflask, has allbeen displaced bytheescaping
hydrogen, thejetmaybe lit.This canbedone safely bycollecting
theescaping gasinaninverted test-tube (downward displacement of
air),carrying thetubemouth downwards toaflame atsome distance
from theapparatus, andthen igniting thegas.Continue tocollect and
testthegasinthismanner until itburns quietly andwithnoexplosion.
Then usethistest-tube ofburning hydrogen toignite theescaping
gasatthe jet. Ifaglass jet isused, theflame hasayellowish tinge
because ofthesodium compounds intheglass, but ifametallic jetor
ashort piece ofclay pipe-stem issubstituted, apale-blue, almost
colorless, flame results. Ifthisflame isallowed tostrike against the
surface ofaglass retort, cooled bycirculating water, thesteam formed
bythecombustion ofthehydrogen iscondensed and visible drops of
water trickle offtheretort.
Although hydrogen itself burns, itwillnotsupport combustion.
This iseasily demonstrated byinserting ablazing splint intoanin-
verted bottle ofhydrogen. Thehydrogen ignites with a“pop” and
50 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
continues toburn atthemouth ofthebottle where itisincontact
with theoxygen ofthe air,buttheblazing splint inside thebottle is
extinguished. Ifthesplint isslowly withdrawn through theregion of
burning gas, itwillberelighted bythealmost invisible flame atthe
mouth ofthebottle.Avariation ofthisexperiment isemployed asa
test forhydrogen. When alighted
splint, introduced intoabottle of
gas,produces asharp “pop” and
analmost colorless flame thatforms
water asitsonlyproduct, itmaybe
assumed that thisgas ishydrogen.
Because hydrogen hasastrong
affinity, orattraction foroxygen, it
canremove oxygen frommany me-
tallic oxides. InFig. 6.7,acurrent
ofdryhydrogen isbeing passed
over red-hot black cupric oxide.A
liquid thatproves tobewater col-
lects inthecooler part ofthetube
andtheblack oxide changes toa
reddish colour. The change in
colour isbrought about bythefor-
mation ofamixture ofred(cuprous)
oxide andmetallic copper. The ability ofhydrogen toremove oxygen
from acompound andtounite chemically with itmakes hydrogen a
reducing agent, andthechemical process iscalled reduction. Oxi-
dation andreduction areopposite processes andreduction isalways
accompanied byoxidation, because ifonesubstance isbeing reduced,
another substance must beundergoing oxidation. Inthisexperiment,
thecupric oxide hasbeenreduced toredcuprous oxide andmetallic
copper, while thehydrogen hasbeen oxidized toform water. The
cupric oxide acted asan“oxygen giver” and iscalled anoxidizing
agent. Thehydrogen acted asan“oxygen taker” (deoxidizer) and
iscalled areducing agent.
Hydrogen reduces theoxides ofmost oftheheavier metals ina
similar manner, butcannot reduce theoxides ofthelighter metals,
potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, andaluminum. There are
other reducing agents more commercially useful than hydrogen.
Carbon intheform ofcoal orcoke iscommonly used inindustry
(p.170).
Hydrogen andchlorine combine gradually indiffused daylight, but
unite explosively ifexposed todirect sunlight, forming hydrogenFig. 6.6.Hydrogen burning quietly

hydrogen sulphide, andwith nitrogen (under pressure and inthe
presence ofcatalysts) toformammonia (p.249).
Uses ofhydrogen. Because ofitsextreme lightness, large quantities
ofhydrogen have longbeen used toinflate balloons and dirigibles, but
thedanger offireorexplosions from lightning and electrical sparks
makes itsuseextremely dangerous, andthehistory ofhydrogen-filled
aircraft hashadmore than itsshare oftragedy. TheUnited States
possesses alarger supply ofhelium thananyother nation, obtaining
itbycondensation fromTexas andOklahoma natural gases. While

Hydrogen wasformerly used tocutandweld metals inanoxy-
hydrogen blowpipe, similar totheoxy-acetylene burner shown in
Fig. 17.16. This type ofburner wasinvented more than ahundred
years agoandhasbeen largely replaced bythehotter oxy-acetylene
flame. Theblastlamp often used inthelaboratory tobend orwork
glass isamodification oftheoxy-hydrogen blowpipe. Here, illuminat-
inggas(containing hydrogen mixed withother gases) burns inastream
ofcompressed airwithamuch hotter flame than theBunsen flame, the
usual source ofheat forchemical experiments. Recently, anextremely
hotflame (about 4,000° C.)hasbeendeveloped byanelectric welding
arcusing “atomic hydrogen”. Inthisinvention, hydrogen gas ispassed
through anelectric arccreated between tungsten electrodes. This
splits thehydrogen molecules into theiratoms (seeChapter 11).On
leaving thearc,theatoms combine again toform molecules andthe
heat, absorbed from thearcinorder tobreak upthemolecules, isnow
released andadded tothatproduced bytheburning ofthehydrogen
asitcombines with theoxygen ofairsurrounding thearc.

Fuel gases such aswater gasandilluminating gasthat contain
appreciable quantities ofhydrogen areextremely useful forheating
and lighting. When petroleum isrefined, hydrogen isused toincrease
theyield ofgasoline. England andGermany have plants thatconvert
cheap grades ofcoalintogasoline andlubricating oilsbyusing hydro-
genunder pressure asapart oftheconversion process. Wood alcohol
(methyl hydrate) canbemade byheating wood intheabsence ofair,
butlarge quantities ofthisproduct arenowmanufactured bythe
union ofhydrogen with carbon monoxide gas inthepresence ofa
suitable catalyst. Hydrogen canalsobemade tocombine with the
nitrogen ofair,forming ammonia gasused inthemanufacture of
artificial fertilizers (p.250).Hydrogen willalsocombine with chlorine
inthemanufacture ofhydrochloric acid. While hydrogen hassome
laboratory useasa“reducing agent”, inindustry itismuch cheaper
andalsomore convenient tousecoke orsome other form ofcarbon.

CHAPTER 7
Water: TheUniversal Solvent
Water isabsolutely indispensable tobothanimal andvegetable life;
itisthecause ofmany ofthemost striking phenomena innature;and
itisemployed forcountless purposes byman.
P.F.Frankland
Forhundreds ofyears, water wasthought tobeanelement, because
ithadnever been broken down intosimpler substances. Cavendish
andLavoisier, atthebeginning ofthenineteenth century, proved that
water wasacompound ofthetwocolorless gases, oxygen andhydrogen.
Occurrence. Water isourmost useful andabundant compound.
Great bodies ofwater cover about five-sevenths oftheearth’s surface,
extending inplaces toadepth ofover fivemiles. Inthepolar regions
andonhighmountains, itoccurs asvast quantities oficeandsnow.
Evensome ofthesolid rocks oftheearth’s crust holdwater inchemical
combination. Itispresent inallfertile soil,andinthevapour state it
isavariable butimportant component oftheatmosphere, fromwhich
itcondenses and isprecipitated invarious forms. Allliving tissues,
both plantandanimal, contain water, andhence itforms animportant
part ofourcommon foods. Such foods astomatoes, cucumbers,
lettuce, andcabbage contain more than90% water. Milk hasabout
87%, andlean beefandeggsalmost 74%. Nearly 79% ofourbody
weight iswater, theamount varying from90% intheblood toavery
small percentage inthebones and teeth.
Importance. Water isthemostimportant ofallchemical compounds.
Inchemistry, itsimportance stems largely from itsremarkable ability
todissolve other substances, including solids, gases, andother liquids.
Itissometimes called “the universal solvent” because itwilldissolve
aportion ofalmost every known substance. Theamounts dissolved
arenotnecessarily large, butwater’s unique ability todissolve sub-
stances accounts foritscommon useinmaking solutions. Somany
chemical reactions depend upon thepresence ofwater thatinorganic
chemistry islargely thechemistry ofwater solutions.
Natural waters. Because ofthegreat solvent action ofwater, all
natural waters contain avariety ofsubstances insolution. Rainwater
isrelatively pure since itisformed bythecondensation ofwater
vapour andhasbeen incontact onlywiththeatmosphere. Atmospheric
56
WATER: THEUNIVERSAL SOLVENT 57
oxygen, nitrogen, andcarbon dioxide maybetaken into solution as
thedrops fallthrough the air,andeven solid dust particles maybe
included inthedrops. Assoon astherain strikes thesurface ofthe
ground, itbegins atonce todissolve soluble materials from the soil,
rocks, andvegetation. Before itforms lakesand rivers, some ofthis
water flows along thesurface becoming moreandmore heavily laden
with dissolved mineral salts.Much ofitfinally reaches theoceans,
andocean waters have adissolved mineral-salt content ofabout 3-5%.
Approximately 2-5% ofseawater iscommon saltandtheremaining
saltcontent ischiefly composed of
compounds ofcalcium, magnesium,
iron,andpotassium.
Rainwatermaypenetrate deeply
intothesoilandunderlying rocks
andemerge later asaspring orwell.
Since the soilacts asafilter, this
watermaybeclearandsparkling,
but itwillcontain minerals dis-
solved from the soil. Inlimestone
regions this soilwater becomes
veryhard since itdissolves certain
calcium and magnesium com-
pounds. Hard waters aregenerally
objectionable. Theydemand awastage ofsoap before alather can
beproduced, andleave adeposit ofscale insteam boilers that results
inclogging aswell asfuelwastage. Many river waters contain not
only substances insolution, butalsosuspended matter intheform
offineclayandsand that give thewaters aturbid appearance. Or-
ganic matter from aquatic plant life,from fragments ofvegetation,
andfrom sewage may alsobecarried insuspension andmaymake
thewater unfit fordrinking purposes. Any bacteria, feeding onthisor-
ganic matter, multiply ataprodigious rate.
When water isclear, freefrom harmful germs, andminus objection-
able dissolved chemicals, itisconsidered good drinking water and is
called potable water. Water mayhave abadodour andtaste but still
besafetodrink ifthebacteria present arenotdisease-producing. Such
water issaid tobepolluted. If,however, water contains harmful
disease-producing germs, itisknown asinfected water andcanonly
bemade safe fordrinking byboiling orbyother treatments that will
kill allsuchgerms.
Purification. Oneofthemostimportant problems facing every com-
munity isthat ofobtaining anadequate supply ofgood drinking water.Permutit Company

tubes. Such deposits, caused byhard
water, result inagreat waste offuel.
58 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Most communities arecompelled topurify their water supply byone
ormore ofthefollowing processes, andtheprocess orcombination of
processes selected depends onthenature oftheimpurities inthewater:
1.Aeration. Some cities aerate their water supply byspraying it
intotheairorbyallowing ittorunoveranincline inthinsheets to
bring itintocontact with theoxygen ofairandtheultra-violet rays
ofsunlight. Theoxidation ofobjectionable organic matter improves
thetaste ofthewater andalso killsmany bacteria.
2.Settling basins (sedimentation ).Verymuddy water, orwater
charged withsewage andother suspended matter, isoften temporarily
stored inlarge settling tanks. Here
thecoarser suspended matter grad-
ually settles andthesurface water
canthen bedrawn offforfurther
treatment.3.
Alum treatment {coagulation).
Aturbid, orcoloured, water supply
isoften treated withsmallamounts
ofaluminum sulphate orwith a
mixture ofalum andslaked lime.
This treatment causes theforma-
tion ofawhite, jelly-like precipi-
tatethat slowly settles tothebot-
tomandcarries with itmuch ofthe
suspended matter, atthesame
timeremoving thecolouring matter
andsome bacteria.
4.Sand filtration. Ifthealum treatment isfollowed byfiltration
through extensive beds ofsandandgravel floored withdrainage tile,
most ofthesuspended particles, including some bacteria, willbe
effectively removed. Itshould benoted, however, that filtration does
notremove dissolved matter from thewater.
5.Chlorination orozonation. Even after filtration, water contains
some bacteria. Acommon method ofpurification istreatment by
small quantities ofchlorine, either asliquid chlorine supplied from
cylinders, orasbleaching powder (chloride oflime). Ozone, anallo-
tropic form ofoxygen (p.172), issometimes used instead ofchlorine,
especially inEuropean cities. Theexplanation ofthereaction isessen-
tially thesame forboth chlorine andozone; atomic oxygen, liberated
byeach substance, destroys thegerms byoxidation.
Chlorine frequently actsonindustrial wastes inthewater topro-
duce substances with objectionable tastes. However, when chlorine isc.I.L.

tanks isfedintothewater purification
system oftheMontreal Waterworks.
Rateandvolume offlow iscontrolled
andmeasured byautomatic
instruments.
WATER: THEUNIVERSAL SOLVENT 59
added inexcessive quantities (super-chlorination), some ofthese
objectionable tastes areremoved. The objectionable chlorine taste
that would then bepresent isremoved with sulphur dioxide
(Chapter 19).
Distillation ofwater. Themethods ofpurification justdiscussed
arequite effective inproducing wholesome drinking water suitable
formost domestic uses.Noonemethod isdesigned toproduce pure
water inthechemical sense, sincemost ofthedissolved impurities are
unaffected bythese treatments. Toprepare chemically purewater for
scientific use,advantage istaken ofthefact thatwater iseasily
changed intosteam. Most ofthedissolved substances arenotvolatile
andremain inthevessel inwhich thewater isboiled. Distillation isa
double process involving twochanges ofstate: vaporization ofaliquid,
and itssubsequent condensation.
InFig. 7.3,natural water isboiled intheflask (A),andtheresulting
steam iscondensed while passing through theinner tube(B)ofthe
Liebig condenser. Astream ofcoldwater, flowing through theouter
glass jacket (C),keeps theinner tube cold.Asaresult ofthis treat-
ment, distilled water, freed from alldissolved andsuspended matter,
fallsfrom thelower endofthetube. This distillate, when collected in
aclean separate container, hasaflatinsipid taste.The firstportion
ofthedistillate maycontain traces ofredissolved gases and isusually
discarded. Ordinary distillation isaprocess whereby avolatile solvent
isseparated from non-volatile solutes (Chapter 8).
60 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Fractional distillation. Frequently itisdesirable toseparate a
mixture ofseveral liquids thathave different boiling points. Thiscan
beaccomplished byfractional distillation, aprocess necessitating
controlled heating. The liquid with thelowest boiling point will distil
offfirst,then theliquid with thenextlowest boiling point, andsoon.
Each separate distillate isknown asafraction. Fig. 7.4shows a
distilling flask fitted with athermometer, thebulb ofwhich isjust
below theside-arm oftheflask. Consider thechanges thattake place
when theflask, containing amixture ofalcohol andwater isheated.
Atnormal pressure, ethyl alcohol boils at78°C.whereas water boils
at100°C.When thethermo-
meter indicates atemperature
of78°C.,themixture inthe
flask isagitated bytheescap-
ingalcohol vapour andadis-
tillate, composed principally
ofalcohol butcontaining a
little water, collects. Thesep-
aration isnotcomplete be-
cause water evaporates at
temperatures below itsboiling
point, andconsiderable water
vapour passes overwith the
alcohol vapour. The first frac-
tionmay besuccessively re-
distilled toyield apurer
product. Finally, astage is
reached where the distillate
is96% alcohol and4%water
,F474Fractional distillation. Useful andfurther distillation pro-mseparating liquids ofdifferent boiling points.,....duces nofurther reduction in
thewater content.
Petroleum, orcrude oil, isamixture ofanumber ofhydrocarbons
(compounds containing onlycarbon andhydrogen) such asnaphtha,
gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oils, vaseline, paraffin, andother pro-
ducts. Because theyhave different boiling points, these fractions may
beseparated byheating thecrude oilinlarge iron stills. This distilla-
tion willbeexplained ingreater detail inChapter 18.
Some complex solids such ascoalandwood aredecomposed when
they areheated away from contact with air(dry distilled). The
volatile products arecondensed. This process iscalled destructive
distillation, and willbediscussed further inChapter 17.
WATER: THEUNIVERSAL SOLVENT 61
Physical properties ofwater. Water isatransparent liquid, colorless
inthin layers butshowing adistinct blue orbluish-green colour in
large bodies. Pure water isodorless and tasteless, butgood drinking
water hasapleasant taste because itcontains dissolved gases and
minerals. Chemically purewater isanexceedingly poorconductor of
electricity andheat.
Some ofthephysical properties ofwater areused asstandards of
comparison when determining thecorresponding physical properties
ofsubstances generally. Thus theweight ofasubstance, compared
with theweight ofanequal volume ofwater, iscalled itsspecific
gravity. Thegram, aunit ofweight, isdefined astheweight of1cc.
ofwater at4°C.Inthermometry, theboiling point ofwater (at
760mm.) is100° C.,and itsfreezing point (at760mm.) is0°C.These
two fixed temperatures canbedetermined easily byexperiment.
Wafer isalsochosen asastandard forcomparison inthemeasurement
ofthespecific heat ofvarious substances. Water hasaheat ofvapor-
ization of540calories andaheat offusion of80calories.

2.Water reacts with themore active metals, liberating hydrogen
andforming abase:

3.Water reacts with oxides ofnon-metals (acid anhydrides) toform
acids:

Sulphur dioxide-f-Water Sulphurous acid
4.Water reacts with basic oxides toformcompounds known as
bases:
Calcium oxide+Water—>Calcium hydroxide
5.Inmany reactions, water acts asacatalytic agent, causing
chemical changes thatdonottake place with perfectly drymaterials.
Forexample, phosphorus willnotburn inperfectly dry air,but itwill
burn readily ifeven atrace ofwater vapour ispresent. Experiments
havebeenperformed toshow thatamixture ofperfectly dryhydrogen
andoxygen willnotexplode when anelectric spark ispassed through
themixture.
6.Water causes acids, bases, and salts todissociate into ions, a
process that willbeexplained inChapter 16.

Fig. 7.5.Four hydrates commonly used inthelaboratory.
Hydrates. Some substances, incrystallizing from awater solution,
unite with adefinite amount ofwater toform crystalline substances
called hydrates. This water, unlike thattrapped incrystals that de-
crepitate when heated, isadefinite part ofthesubstance formed.
When hydrates areheated, theydecompose toformanhydrous salts
andwater. This chemical reaction iscalled dehydration. Conversely,
when water isadded toananhydrous salt,ahydrate isformed and
heat isproduced. This action iscalled hydration. Ifwater isadded to
anhydrous copper sulphate, thesaltturns from white toblue. This
hydration isrepresented bythefollowing equation:
Anhydrous copper sulphate +Water-—y
Bluestone (ahydrate)
Ifacrystal ofbluestone isheated inatest-tube, itquietly changes
intoanon-crystalline white powder, anddrops ofacolorless liquid
appear onthesides ofthetube. This liquid, when tested, proves tobe
water. This action isrepresented bythefollowing word equation:
Bluestone—->Anhydrous copper sulphate +Water
When thebluestone loses itswater, italso loses itscrystal form.
Thewater contained inthehydrate iscalled water ofhydration and
ispresent inafixed proportion byweight. Although thiswater of
hydration isanessential part ofthehydrate, itmust notbeassumed
that allcrystals arehydrates. Common salt crystallizes inperfect
cubes but itisnotahydrate.
Certain hydrates hold theirwater ofhydration soweakly that the
crystals, when exposed toair,slowly lose their water ofhydration,

become covered with awhite powder, and finally crumble intoan
anhydrous form. Such hydrates aresaid tobeefflorescent andthe
action iscalled efflorescence. Washing sodaand“hypo” crystals show
thisproperty inordinary air,while bluestone will effloresce ifthe
atmosphere isvery dry.
Deliquescence. Another kind ofaction occurs when some very
soluble solids areexposed toair.Calcium chloride absorbs moisture
from theairtoform aconcentrated solution, andthisproperty makes
ituseful tokeepdown road dust. This action ispurely oneofsolution
and isnotachemical change. Substances likecalcium chloride, sodium
hydroxide, andmagnesium chloride, whichmayform solutions when
exposed toair,aresaid tobedeliquescent, and thisaction iscalled
deliquescence. Such substances canbeused asdrying agents to
remove moisture from various gases.
Test forwater.Awhite powder, known asanhydrous copper sul-
phate, maybeprepared byheating bluestone inadrytest-tube until
itswater ofhydration isdriven off. Ifthiswhite powder changes to
blueontheaddition ofaliquid, itmaybeassumed that theliquid
iswater orcontains water.
More exacting testshavebeen devised that willdetect thepresence
ofwater aswellasdetermine itspurity, butthese arebeyond thescope
ofthepresent treatment.
Composition ofwater. Instudying chemical compounds, itisof
great importance tobeable todetermine theexact quantity ofthe
constituent elements ofeachcompound. Onpage 100there isalist
ofcompounds thatshows thepercentage composition ofeach. This
tableshows thatwater hasafixed composition of88-88% oxygen and
11-11% hydrogen, byweight. Again, onpage 64reference ismade to
thefactthatwatermaybedecomposed intothetwogases, hydrogen
andoxygen, intheratio of2volumes ofhydrogen to1volume of
64 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
oxygen. Thecomposition ofwater cantherefore beexpressed either
involume units orinweight units.Themethods used indetermining
thecomposition ofwater aretypical ofthose used todetermine the
composition ofother compounds.
Two general plans ofattack arecommonly used todetermine the
composition ofanycompound:
1.Decomposing thecompound tofindoutwhat elements are
present. This chemical process iscalled analysis (Gr.ana,adistri-
bution; lysis, loosing).
cl.Combining theelements toform thecompound. This isknown as
synthesis (Gr. syn,with; tithemi, toplace).
Analysis ofwater. Theproportions (byvolume) ofhydrogen and
oxygen, theelements composing water, maybedetermined bydecom-
posing water bythepassage ofanelectric current intheprocess called
electrolysis (Fig. 7.7),making useoftheHoffman apparatus.
Since distilled water isapoor conductor ofelectricity, asmall
amount ofsulphuric acid isadded tomake thewater abetter conductor.
When thereaction ends, theamount ofsulphuric acid isunchanged,
buttheamount ofwater hasdecreased.
TheHoffman apparatus operates asfollows: With both stop-cocks
open, theacidulated water ispoured intothecentre tube, which acts
asareservoir, until thetwoouter tubes are filled.Thestop-cocks are
then closed andtheplatinum electrodes areconnected with a6-to
10-volt storage battery oranyother source ofdirect current. Platinum
electrodes areusedbecause thismetal isvery resistant toattack by
most substances. Assoon asthecircuit isclosed, small bubbles ofa
colorless gascollect onthesurface oftheelectrodes andthen rise
through theacidulated water togather atthetopofthetwoouter
tubes. Asthese gases collect, some ofthewater isdisplaced intothe
third vertical tubeandforced intothereservoir atthetop.
Thegascollected overthenegative electrode (cathode) ishydrogen.
This canbeshown byopening thestop-cock andcollecting some of
thegas inaninverted test-tube. When thetube isbrought neara
flame, thecharacteristic “pop” isheard andthegasburns withapale-
blue flame. Oxygen collects over thepositive electrode (anode) and
canbeidentified byopening thestop-cock andtesting theescaping
gaswithaglowing splint asdescribed inChapter 4.
Regardless ofthetime thecurrent flows, thevolume ofgascollected
over thecathode isalways twice thevolume ofgascollected over the
anode. Thewhole experiment demonstrates thatwater isacompound
consisting oftwovolumes ofhydrogen combined withonevolume of
oxygen.
WATER: THEUNIVERSAL SOLVENT 65
Synthesis ofwater. Incontrast toanalysis asaccomplished by
electrolysis, water canbebuiltupfrom itsconstituent elements. To
determine thecomposition ofwater (oranycompound) bysynthesis,
twomethods ofcomputation maybeused:
A.Synthesis ofwater by
volume. The proportions by
volume ofhydrogen andoxy-
genthat will unite toform
watermaybedetermined in
agraduated tube called a
eudiometer. This isaheavy-
walled tube closed atoneend.
Near theclosed end,twoplat-
inum wires aresealed through
theglass with their ends al-
most meeting. This creates a
spark gap across which an
electric spark canbepassed
inorder toignite themixture
ofgases inthetube.The re-
sulting combustion takes the
form ofanexplosion, pro-
ducing water through the
union offixed proportions of
thetwogases.
The eudiometer isfilled
with mercury and inverted
over thesame liquid inatall
hydrometer jar, permitting
adjustments inthemercury

enclosed gases areread.A Fig. 7.7.The electrolysis ofwater using

next introduced and the
eudiometer isthenlowered sothatthelevel ofthemercury inside and

beunder atmospheric pressure, and itsvolume isaccurately readand

same manner, and after again adjusting thelevels thetotalvolume
ofthemixture iscarefully read.Aninduction coil,operated bya6-volt

thevolume oftheunused (residual) gasintheeudiometer isthen taken.
Ifanother spark ispassed through theresidual gas,nothing happens
because only aportion ofoneofthetwooriginal gases remains after

Suppose thatthemeasured volumes used inaparticular experiment
were asfollows:
WATER: THEUNIVERSAL SOLVENT 67
1.Volume ofhydrogen introduced 18cc.
2.Total volume ofthemixture (hydrogen andoxygen) 35cc.
3.Total volume ofoxygen (bysubtraction) ... 17cc.
4.Volume ofresidual gas(proved tobeoxygen bya
glowing splint test) 8cc.

(18cc.)toform water. Similarly had22cc.ofhydrogen and8cc.of
oxygen been introduced intotheeudiometer andaspark passed, 6cc.
ofhydrogen would haveremained asaresidual gasinthetube. Itis
onlywhen twovolumes ofhydrogen aremixed withoneofoxygen
thatthetwogases totally disappear, butaspreviously mentioned this
isanundesirable procedure. Regardless ofthenumber oftimes the

hydrogen combine with 1volume ofoxygen toform water.
B,Synthesis ofwater byweight. Thecomposition ofwater byweight
maybedetermined bythereduction ofanoxide (such ascupric oxide)
with dryhydrogen.
method wasusedbythegreat French scientist JeanDumas and isoften referred to
asDumas’ method.
Hydrogen from aKipp orcylinder enters onthe leftand isdried
bypassing itthrough aU-tube (A)containing adrying agent such as
calcium chloride. Thetube (B)contains cupric oxide andtheweight
oftheignition tubewith itscontents isrecorded before thereduction
begins. Thedryhydrogen reduces theheated oxide forming copper
andwater (asavapour). Thisvapour iscarried along bytheexcess of
hydrogen andabsorbed inthecalcium chloride tubes (C+D).The
weight of(C+D) isalsodetermined prior totheexperiment. After
thecupric oxide hasbeen reduced, theapparatus isallowed tocool to
room temperature. Then thetubes (B)and(C+D)and their con-
68 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
tents arere-weighed. The increase inweight ofthetubes (C+D)
represents theweight ofthewater formed. The lossinweight in(B)
gives theweight oftheoxygen used.Thedifference between theweight
ofthewater formed andtheweight oftheoxygen used gives the
weight ofthehydrogen used.Thefollowing data aretheresults ofsuch
anexperiment:
1.Wt.oftube (B)andcupric oxide before reduction 42-901 gm.
2.Wt.oftube(B)andcontents after reduction .41-701 gm.
{a)wt.ofoxygen used (l)-(2) . . . .1-20 gm.
3.Wt.ofcalcium chloride tubes (C+D)and
contents afterexperiment 50-87 gm.
4.Wt.ofcalcium chloride tubes (C+D)and
contents before experiment 49-52 gm.
(b)wt.ofwater formed (3)- (4).... 1-35 gm.
(c)therefore weight ofhydrogen used to
create water (b)-(a) 0-15 gm.
Thus, inthis particular experiment, 0-15gm. ofhydrogen have
combined with 1-20gm.ofoxygen toform 1-35gm.ofwater, orin
round numbers, 1partbyweight ofhydrogen combined with 8parts
byweight ofoxygen inthesynthesis ofwater.
Themethod justdescribed was firstused in1819bytwo scientists,
Berzelius andDulong. In1842, thegreat French chemist, JeanDumas,
repeated more accurately thework ofthese earlier scientists. Asa
result ofnineteen separate experiments, Dumas found that840-161
grams ofoxygen wereused intheformation of945-439 grams ofwater.
Theweights ofhydrogen andoxygen thus ascertained stand inthe
ratio of1gram ofhydrogen to7-98grams ofoxygen.
In1895, anAmerican chemist, Edward Morley, synthesized water
from purehydrogen andpureoxygen. Hemore accurately determined
theproportion tobe8partsbyweight ofoxygen to1-008 parts by
weight ofhydrogen.
The investigation ofthenature ofwater produced newmethods
andtechniques which became available tochemists forfurther re-
search. Themethods bywhich ourknowledge ofwater hasbeen ex-
panded produced apattern whereby many other more complex sub-
stances have been analyzed andsynthesized.

CHAPTER 8
Solutions
Inthestrictly scientific sense oftheword, insolubility doesnotexist,
andeven those substances characterized bythemost obstinate re-
sistance tothesolvent action ofwatermay properly bedesignated
merely asextraordinarily difficult ofsolution, notasinsoluble.
O.N.Witt
Solution terms. Little didthealchemists, intheir search forthe
universal solvent, suspect theyhadthenearest thing toitalways at
hand. One ofthemost important properties ofwater isitsability to
dissolve somany different substances. There isscarcely asubstance
thatdoesnotdissolve inwater tosome extent. Even sand, glass, and
gold are allslightly soluble, butbecause solittle ofthem dissolves
they areconsidered insoluble. When apinch ofsalt isstirred ina
beaker ofwater, thesaltdissolves andforms asolution. The salt, or
thesubstance dissolved, iscalled thesolute, andthewater thatdoes
thedissolving isthesolvent. Theresulting mixture isadilute solution.
Ifadditional salt isused, theclear solution might bedescribed asmore
concentrated. Asmall crystal ofcopper sulphate, stirred inabeaker
ofwater, imparts auniform blue colour tothewhole solution, which
nevertheless remains entirely transparent. Both thesolute andthe
solvent willpassthrough afilter paper. Allsamples ofawell stirred
sugar solution seem totaste equally sweet. These facts indicate a
uniform distribution ofthesolute throughout thesolvent. Sosmall
aretheparticles ofsolute thattheycannot beseenevenwithapower-
fulmicroscope. Thisuniformity andclearness ofsolutions isaccounted
forbythemolecular dispersion ofthesolute (see p.113).Asolution
hasthesame composition throughout, and issaidtobeahomogeneous
mixture.
Types ofsolutions. Themostcommon type ofsolution isasolid
dissolved inaliquid. However, asolution may consist ofanyofthe
nine possible variations ofasolid, liquid, orgasdissolved inasolid,
71
72 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
liquid, orgas.Assome ofthese areunusual, only themostcommon
types willbedealt with, namely:
1.Solids dissolved inliquids.
2.Gases dissolved inliquids.
3.Liquids dissolved inliquids.
4.Gases dissolved ingases.
5.Liquids dissolved ingases.
Solids inliquids. When clay isstirred inwater, asuspension results.
Theclayhasnotdissolved andthemixture isturbid. Ifthemixture is
allowed tostand, thecoarser particles will settle out; iffiltered, the
clay willremain asaresidue onthe filter paper andthewater, asa
filtrate, willpassthrough.
Whether asolid willdissolve ornotdepends onthenature ofthe
solidandofthesolvent. Sand, iodine, andsteel arepractically insoluble
inwater while sugar isquite soluble. Although water isthecommonest
solvent, itisnottheonly one.Some substances, insoluble inwater,
will dissolve inother solvents. Iodine dissolves readily inalcohol
forming abrown solution soldunder thename oftincture ofiodine.
Because carbon tetrachloride isanexcellent solvent forgrease, itis
used inthedrycleaning industry.
Theproportion ofsolute tosolvent inasolution issometimes repre-
sented bypercent. Thus a“3% solution ofiodine” means that the
solution contains 3partsbyweight ofiodine to97partsbyweight of
thesolvent; i.e.3partsbyweight ofsolute in100partsbyweight of
solution.
Rate ofsolution ofsolids inliquids. Alump ofsugar willdissolve
more rapidly inhotthan incoldwater, and ifthelump isfirstpulver-
ized itwilldissolve stillmore rapidly. Stirring willfurther hasten the
rate ofsolution. Thus thefactors influencing thespeed ofthedis-
solving process arethree innumber:
1.Temperature. Most solids dissolve more rapidly ifthesolvent is
warmed.
2.Area ofsurface. Thegreater thesurface area ofthesolute, the
faster itwilldissolve.
3.Agitation,orstirring, speeds thedissolving process. Previously,
reference wasmade tothesolution formed bystirring saltwith water.
Even without stirring, thesaltintimewould have diffused completely
through thewater toform eventually ahomogeneous mixture.
Asmall crystal ofbluestone placed atthebottom ofatallcylinder
ofwater diminishes involume asitdiffuses through thesolvent. The
kinetic energy ofthemolecules (p.113) causes them toleave the
surface ofthesolid, thus exposing new surfaces ofthesolute. This
SOLUTIONS 73
continues together with thesubsequent intermingling with water
molecules. Itmay take several months forthesolution tohave the
same “blueness” throughout, buteventually themixture becomes
truly homogeneous.
Gases inwater.Abeaker ofcold“tapwater” contains dissolved air
and isperfectly clear. Ifthebeaker isallowed tostand inawarm
room, thetemperature ofthesolution risesandbubbles ofoxygen and
nitrogen come outofthesolution. The factthatatmospheric oxygen
dissolves inwater isofgreat importance innature because this dis-
solved oxygen enables aquatic plants andanimals tobreathe. Dissolved
oxygen isalsoimportant because itaidsdecay through oxidation of
dead organisms thatwould otherwise accumulate and pollute all
waters. Some gases, likeammonia, arevery soluble inwater; others,
likehydrogen, areonly slightly soluble. Allgases aremore soluble in
coldwater than inhot,and their solubility isalsoincreased byan
increase inpressure. Inthemanufacture ofsoftdrinks, carbon dioxide
under pressure isdissolved inaflavoured sugar solution, andthe
bottle iscapped toprevent theescape ofgas.When thecap isremoved
thedecreased pressure permits some ofthegastoescape andthe
familiar effervescence results.
Liquids inwater. Some liquids (alcohol, sulphuric acid,andvinegar)
willmixwithwater inallproportions toform solutions. They aresaid
tobemiscible. Other liquids (gasoline, mercury, andcarbon disul-
phide) arealmost completely insoluble inwater and willnotform
solutions with it.They aresaidtobeimmiscible. Ifkerosene isshaken
with water, themixture soon separates intotwo layers. Ifsoap is
added andthemixture again shaken, thesoap surrounds thetiny
droplets ofkerosene andkeeps them apart. Thedroplets willremain
dispersed inthewater foralong time.Such asuspension ofoneliquid
inanother iscalled anemulsion. Soap isanemulsifying agent. An
emulsion isnotasolution butamechanical mixture ofoneliquid in
another liquid inwhich separation takes place very slowly. Mayon-
naise dressing isanemulsion ofoilandvinegar, witheggadded asthe
emulsifying agent. Incommon with other emulsions, milk isnotclear
likeasolution but isturbid. Some liquids, partially miscible, liebe-
tween alcohol andcarbon disulphide inthemanner inwhich theymix
with water. Ether willdissolve inwater toacertain extent, andthen
itbecomes immiscible inthesolution. Two layers willform, thetop
oneconsisting ofthesolvent ether with dissolved water, and the
bottom layercomposed ofasolution ofether inwater.
Gases ingases. Allgases aremiscible withoneanother inallpro-
portions regardless oftheir densities. Hence noseparation ofthe
74 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
atmospheric gases takes place. Air isahomogeneous mixture and is
therefore atrue solution.
Liquids ingases. Water, exposed toair,evaporates. Just assalt
dissolves inwater toform asolution, sodoeswater, when evaporated,
dissolve inair.Relative humidity istheterm used toexpress therela-
tionship between themass ofwater vapour dissolved inacertain
volume ofairandthemass ofwater vapour thesame aircould
hold ifsaturated atthesame temperature. Thus, when therelative
humidity is40%, theair isholding insolution 40% ofthewater
vapour itcould hold atthesame temperature ifitwere saturated.
Thetemperature atwhich theair issaturated withwater vapour is
known asthedew-point.
Saturated andunsaturated solutions. When asmall amount of
sugar isadded tosome water inaflaskandshaken, thesugar soon
dissolves toform asolution. Ifalittlemore sugar isadded andthe
process repeated, thissugar alsodissolves butthistime thedissolving
occurs more slowly than previously. Eventually, however, acondition
willbereached when additional quantities ofsugar willnotdissolve.
Even after shaking, some ofthesugar settles tothebottom ofthe
flask.Noamount ofagitation willcause thisexcess sugar todissolve
inthesolution. The clear solution above theexcess sugar issaidtobe
saturated. Asaturated solution contains asmuch ofthesolute asit
canpossibly dissolve when incontact withanexcess ofthesolute at
aparticular temperature. Theother solutions inwhich more sugar
could bedissolved bymerely shaking were unsaturated solutions at
that particular temperature.
Ifthesaturated solution ofthesugar inwater plustheexcess sugar
isheated, theheating increases thewater’s capacity todissolve sugar,
andtheexcess sugarmaydisappear, andahot,possibly unsaturated,
solution willresult. Ifsufficient sugar isadded tothisclearhotsolution
andthemixture shaken again, asaturated solution withsome excess
solute isobtained. Forevery temperature there isadefinite quantity
ofsolute that willdissolve inadefinite quantity ofsolvent toform a
saturated solution. Most solids aremore soluble inhotwater than in
cold. Ifahotsaturated solution iscooled, some ofthesolute ordinarily
comes outofsolution incharacteristic geometric shapes called crystals.
Common saltandsugar crystals arecubical inshape, ordinary saltpetre
forms needle-like crystals, andalum crystals areeight-sided. Just
enough ofthesolute crystallizes outduring thecooling tokeep the
soiution saturated atthelower temperature.
Supersaturated solutions. Itispossible, however, toprepare a
solution containing more dissolved solute thanwould becontained in
SOLUTIONS 75
asaturated solution atthesame temperature. Ifhotsaturated solu-
tions ofafewsubstances such assodium sulphate, sodium acetate,
andsodium thiosulphate (“hypo”) arecarefully cooled, theexcess
solidmaynotcrystallize out.Theresulting coldsolution holds agreat
dealmore solute thanasaturated onewould atthatsame temperature.
Such asolution iscalled asupersaturated solution.
If,however, acrystal ofthesolute isdropped intothesupersaturated
solution, arapid crystallization begins and willcontinue untilenough
solute precipitates outofsolution toleave thesolution saturated.
When crystallization occurs, thesolution becomes quite warm, as
heat isgenerated bythesolidcoming outofsolution. Aswith unsatur-
ated solutions, anindefinite series ofsupersaturated solutions canbe
prepared. Somemayhave onlyafewgrams more solute than asatur-
ated solution, andothersmayhaveagreat dealmore solute dissolved
inthesame quantity ofsolvent. Thus, foragiven temperature, the
saturated solution istheonlyonehaving adefinite amount ofsolute
dissolved inagiven amount ofsolvent.
Solubility. Theterm solubility isdefined astheweight ofthesolute,
usually expressed ingrams, that will dissolve inagiven amount of
thesolvent {usually 100grams ofwater) toform asaturated solution
atagiven temperature. Thus thestatement that thesolubility of
potassium nitrate at15°C.is21grams means that 21grams of
potassium nitrate willdissolve in100grams ofwater toform asatur-
ated solution at15°C.The solubility ofpotassium nitrate at50°C.is
85grams. The solubility ofpotassium nitrate increases enormously as
thetemperature rises, butthat ofcommon saltchanges very slightly.
Ifthesolubility ofasalt isdetermined experimentally atvarious
temperatures, agraph known asasolubility curvemaybedrawn.
Such graphs arevery useful inshowing thevariation insolubilities at
different temperatures (Fig. 8.1).
Factors affecting thesolubility ofsolids inliquids. Astudy ofthe
solubility curves shows that inmost cases thesolubility ofasalt
increases asthetemperature increases, andthat thedegree ofsolu-
bility depends onthenature ofthesolute. The solubility alsodepends
agreat dealonthenature ofthesolvent, butpressure has little orno
effect onthesolubility ofsolids inliquids.
Theformation ofcrystals. Theamount ofsolute thatcanbeheld in
solution isdecreased either byadrop intemperature orbyevaporation
ofthesolvent. When either occurs, theexcess solidcomes outofsolu-
tion intheform ofcrystals. Ifastring ishung inahotconcentrated
solution ofalum inanopen beaker and leftforseveral days, large
crystals willformonthestring. These crystals always have adefinite
76 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Structure. Ifevaporation takes place slowly, thecrystals formed are
usually largeandcomplete. Iftheevaporation israpid, thecrystals
aresmaller andincomplete.
When crystals areformed byanyoftheabove methods, they often
entrap small quantities ofwater.When acrystal thusformed isheated,
theentrapped water boils, and theresulting steam explodes the
crystal producing acrackling sound likethatnoted when potassium
chlorate crystals were heated. This iscalled decrepitation.

When chemists, byexperiments, have ascertained thesolubilities ofvarious
solids inwater atvarious temperatures, thisinformation canberecorded in
tables, ormaybeshown graphically bysolubility curves similar tothoseshown
inFigure 8.1.The latter method ismore convenient andinformative than tables,
since these curves give thesolubilities atalltemperatures instead ofatafew

Chemical Classification
Itissufficiently clear that allthings arechanged, andnothing really
perishes, andthatthesum ofmatter remains absolutely thesame.
Francis Bacon
TheLaw ofConservation ofMass. Lavoisier discovered that
mercury, heated inair,increased inweight, andthat theincrease in
weight wasexactly equal totheweight ofthatpart oftheairusedup
intheformation ofanewsubstance (Chapter 3).Magnesium, lead,
copper, andother substances alsogain inweight when heated inair,
andthegain inweight isequal totheweight ofoxygen used inthe
chemical action. Before thestudy ofclassification isbegun, itis
necessary toexplore thesignificance oftheinvestigations concerning
increases inweight. Itshould benoted that (1)newsubstances are
formed ineach oftheabove instances, and (2)there hasbeenno
change intotal weight during anyofthese reactions. Thequestion
arises, “Isthistypical ofevery chemical reaction?” Toanswer the
question adequately would necessitate studying every chemical re-
action. Since suchanundertaking isimpossible, onlyafewreactions
willbediscussed here.
Asilver nitrate solution ispoured intoatest-tube andthetest-tube
placed carefully upright inaflask containing asolution ofcommon
saltsothat thetwoclear solutions cannot mix,andastopper isin-
serted firmly intheflask asshown inFig. 9.1A.Thestoppered flask
containing thetwoseparate solutions iscarefully weighed. Then the
flask isinverted toallow thesolutions tomixasshown inFig. 9.IB.
Athick, curdy white precipitate isimmediately formed. Aprecipitate
isaninsoluble solidformed asanewsubstance when achemical reaction
takes place between solutions. Itisevident that inthisexperiment a
chemical change hastaken place, because anewsubstance, differing
inproperties from thetwo original substances, hasbeen formed.
When thestoppered flask isnowreweighed itisfound that there has
beennochange inweight. The following word equation represents
thisreaction:

Theinsoluble precipitate formed issilver chloride. Thisexperiment
canberepeated using different pairs ofsolutions. Iflead nitrate and
potassium iodide solutions areused, abright yellow precipitate of
leadiodide isformed, andagain there isnolossorgain inweight.
Lead nitrate+Potassium iodide—>Potassium nitrate

Itmaybeargued thatwhen acandle burns, there appears tobea
decided lossinweight asnothing seems leftbehind after theoxidation.
Inthiscase, theproducts ofthereaction areinvisible gases that are
difficult tocatch andweigh. However, thishasbeen done, and ithas
beenfound thattheweight ofthecandle used, plustheweight ofthe
oxygen used, isexactly equal totheweight oftheproducts ofthe
combustion. Many hundreds ofchemical reactions havebeen investi-
gated and inevery instance ithasbeenfound that thetotalweight of
thesubstances formed inanychemical reaction isexactly equal tothetotal
CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION 83
weight ofthesubstances thathaveundergone thechange. Ageneralized
statement telling howmatter behaves under certain conditions is
called aLaw.Thelawjustdeveloped iscalled theLaw ofConservation
ofMass ortheLaw ofConservation ofMatter. Itissometimes stated
as“Matter isneither created nordestroyed inanychemical change.”
Thequantity ofmatter inabody iscalled itsmass, while itsweight
isameasure oftheforce ofattraction oftheearth upon it.Theweight
ofabodydepends upon (1)itsmass, and (2)thedistance ofthebody
from theearth’s centre. Hence weight willchange with altitude while
mass remains thesame. Therefore, itismore accurate torefer tothe
lawastheLaw ofConservation ofMass rather than “ofWeight”.
However, themass ofabody isinpractice (asabove) usually measured
byitsweight since thefactor ofdistance isaconstant inthelaboratory.
Law ofDefinite Proportions. InChapter 7,itwasshown that
oxygen andhydrogen, uniting toform water, didsointheratio of
1volume ofoxygen to2volumes ofhydrogen, andthatwhen water
wasdecomposed itproduced 1volume ofoxygen to2volumes of
hydrogen. Byweight, water consists of88-88% oxygen and11-11%
hydrogen. Chemically purewater hasadefinite composition regardless
ofitssource. Whether itisobtained from themelting ofpure ice,from
thecondensation ofsteam, from thedecomposition ofahydrate, or
from thechemical union ofhydrogen andoxygen gases, itscompo-
sition isalways thesame. Here again aquestion arises, “Do allsamples
ofanychemical compound always have thesame composition?”
Ifmercuric oxide isselected asarepresentative compound, an
experiment may beperformed asillustrated inFig. 9.2.Asmall
amount ofmercuric oxide isplaced inapreviously weighed pyrex
test-tube, andthetwoweighed again andthenheated toeffect de-

contents arereweighed. Following aresome observations froman
actual experiment:

When theanalysis isrepeated anumber oftimes with different
samples ofmercuric oxide, inallcases thepercentage composition is
found tobe(within thelimits ofexperimental error) 92-6% mercury
and74% oxygen. This ratiobyweight never varies. Mercuric oxide
hasafixed composition. Tengrams ofpuremercuric oxide willalways
contain 9-26grams ofmercury and -74grams ofoxygen.

Common saltalways contains sodium andchlorine intheratioby
weight of23parts ofsodium to35-5 parts ofchlorine. Many other
examples could begiven and italways follows that thecomposition
ofacompound isfixed ordefinite. This isoneofthemostfundamental
concepts ofchemistry, andalthough firstformulated byDalton itmay
nowbestated asaLawandcalled theLaw ofDefinite Proportions
ortheLaw ofConstant Composition. Ifallsamples ofachemical
compound beexamined, theproportion byweight oftheelements com-
posing itwillalways bethesame, orthepercentage composition ofa
compound isfixed.Nocircumstances whatever can alter thepro-
portional quantities (byweight) oftheconstituents ofacompound.
Man doesnotknowwhyelements always unite inunvarying pro-
portions. Allthatheknows isthat theCreator hasimpressed this
principle onmatter toman’s advantage. Ifelements didnotunite in
fixedanddefinite proportions, therewould benostability ineither the

stances, andwhat atonetimemight actasamedicine atanother

chemical manufacturer. Heknows that there isoneproportion, and
oneonly, inwhich theconstituents ofthecompound heismanu-
facturing willreact, andhemakes conditions asperfect aspossible to
avoid allneedless waste ofmaterials.
Elements andcompounds. Although prepared byvarious methods,
apuresubstance always hasthesame properties under agiven setof
conditions. Thus oxygen, hydrogen, water, mercury, mercuric oxide,
potassium chlorate, andpotassium chloride, are allpure substances.
Allpuresubstances canbeclassified aseither elements orcompounds.
Anelement isasimple substance thathasnotbeen separated into
simpler substances byordinary chemical means, andthathasnever
beenformed bytheunion ofsimpler substances. Oxygen, hydrogen,
andmercury areelements because, uptothepresent time, none of
them haseverbeenbroken down intotwoormore simpler substances
byasimple chemical reaction. Water, mercuric oxide, potassium
chlorate, andpotassium chloride arecompounds. Every compound is
composed ofatleasttwoelements that arechemically united ina
fixedand definite proportion byweight. Theelements united inthe
compound arecalled theconstituents ofthecompound. Thus the
elements, oxygen andhydrogen, aretheconstituents ofthecompound,
water. Both elements andcompounds arehomogeneous. Inuniting
toform acompound, theelements losetheir identity. Thus water has
quite adifferent “set” ofproperties from either oxygen orhydrogen.

recovered byfiltration. Thesulphur andtheiron inthemixture retain
their original properties andcanbeseparated from oneanother
without achemical change. Ifanalyses weremade from various samples
ofthemixture, theywould show variations intheproportion byweight
ofironandsulphur, thus indicating that amechanical mixture is
heterogeneous. The ingredients ofamixture arecalled thephases
andaresometimes referred toasthecomponents.
Mixtures arebyfarthemostcommon ofsubstances. Infact itis
practically impossible togetanabsolutely pure substance. The label
onabottle ofaso-called chemically pure substance gives theper-
centage ofimpurities eventhough these percentages maybeextremely
small. Innature, pure substances areseldom found inanygreat
quantity.
Examples ofmechanical mixtures. Granite isarock consisting ofa
mixture ofthree minerals, quartz, feldspar, andeither mica orhorn-
blende. River sands aremixtures. Those oftheYukon River contain
gold that, because ofitsdensity, settles tothebottom ofthesluice-
boxwhen theminer carries onhissand-washing operations. The
mixture ofclayandwater referred toinChapter 8,unlike aclear
solution, isturbid. The solid phase canbeseparated from theliquid
phase byfiltration. Theemulsions mentioned inChapter 8areex-
amples ofmixtures. Cream willseparate fromwhole milkvery slowly,
but ifthemilk iswhirled inacentrifuge theseparation occurs more
rapidly. Smoke isamixture because itisasuspension offine solid
particles inair,andclouds andfogaresuspensions oftinydrops of
water inair. Iftheproperties ofthedifferent phases inamixture are
known, itisusually asimple matter toseparate themfromoneanother.
Airisamixture. Airwasonceregarded asanelement. Later, when
itwasfound thatoxygen andnitrogen existed inapproximately con-
stant proportions intheatmosphere, some chemists suggested that
airisatruechemical compound. However, thefollowing reasons make
clear thefactthat airisamixture andnotacompound.
1.Although thecomposition ofair isapproximately constant, the
slight variations existent aresufficient toprove that airisamixture.
Thepercentage composition ofacompound isfixed.
2.When agaseous compound isdissolved inwater, itscomposition
isnotaffected, sothat ifthegas isrecovered byheating thewater, no
alteration incomposition isfound. When water, containing dissolved
air, isheated andtheairdriven outand collected, theexpelled air
contains approximately onevolume ofoxygen totwovolumes of
nitrogen. Innormal air,theratio isapproximately onetofour.
CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION 87
3.Ifoxygen andnitrogen aremixed, noheat isevolved. Noenergy
changes occur intheformation ofamixture.
4.Inamixture, theproperties areadditive. Theproperties ofair
arethose ofamixture ofnitrogen andoxygen, andeach element
retains itsindividual properties. Moreover, amixture ofnitrogen,
oxygen, carbon dioxide, andwater vapour inthesame proportions in
which these substances arefound inaircanbemade, and itshows all
theproperties ofair.
5.Aircanbeseparated into itscomponents bymechanical methods
without achemical reaction. This canbedonebythefractional
distillation ofliquid air,orbymaking useofdifferences indiffusion of
thecomponents. Oxygen escapes through rubber more rapidly than
does nitrogen, sothatthegasinanautomobile tirethathasnotbeen
pumped upforalongtime ismostly nitrogen. Ifoxygen andnitrogen
were combined, theywould pass through therubber with equal
velocities.

ofair(see p.119).

TheGasLaws
Experimentally wedonotknow ofanygasbehaving instrict con-
formity tothelawofBoyle; butinthecaseofmany gases, andofnearly
allgases atvery high temperatures, thedeviation from uniformity is
very slight.
J.B.Stallo
Gases areeasily compressed. Because oftheir relatively large
intermolecular spaces, gases aremore easily compressed than arethe
other states ofmatter. Asmaller volume results asincreased pressure
onagasforces themolecules closer together.
Gases exert pressure. Since molecules areincontinuous motion,
crowding them together into asmaller volume means agreater
molecular bombardment perunit
areaonthewalls ofthecontainer.
A“more compact” gas, therefore,
exerts agreater pressure thanone
inwhich theintermolecular spaces
arelarger. When air isremoved
from abelljarasinFig. 10.1, the
jarcannot easily belifted from its
stand. Thebombardment ofthe
molecules ofairoutside thebelljar
creates apressure much greater
than thatproduced bythefewre-
maining molecules inside the jar.
Ontheother hand,when airisad-
mitted tothebelljartosuchan
extent thatthemolecular bombard-
ment inside thejarequals that outside, theexertion ofaforce just
great enough toovercome theweight ofthebell jar isallthat is
necessary toremove itfrom thestand.
Measuring airpressure. In1643, Torricelli invented aninstrument
formeasuring airpressure. Hetookaglass tubeabout onemetre long,
closed atoneend,and filled itwithmercury (Fig. 10.2). Putting his
finger overtheopen end,heplaced thetube inavertical, butinverted,
position with theopenendunder thesurface ofthemercury inadish,
andthenremoved hisfinger. Themercury fellashort distance inthe

iftheareaonwhich theforce acts is50square inches, apressure of3

Ifabarometer isinclined atdifferent angles, asshown inFig. 10.3,
themercury will rise inthetube, buttheperpendicular distance h,
measured between themercury level inthedishandthelevel ofthe
mercury inthetube, willnotvary. This distance isused toexpress
thevalue ofthepressure exerted bythe air.Thuswhen hmeasures 30
inches, thepressure oftheatmosphere isequal tothat exerted bya
column ofmercury 30inches high.Thestatement, “The pressure is30
inches,” means thattheairispressing with sufficient force tosupport a
column ofmercury inabarometer tube toaheight of30inches.
Theaverage pressure atsealevel is760millimetres (76cm.). This is

Boyle’s Law.Anincrease ofpressure onagasdecreases itsvolume.
Theexact relation between thevolume ofagiven mass ofgasandthe
pressure exerted upon itwas first
determined byRobert Boyle in
1662. Boyle wasattempting to
explain thevarious lengths of
mercury columns intheTorri-
cellian tube (barometer). Heused
aU-tube, sealed atoneendasin
Fig. 10.4, andpoured injust
enough mercury to fillthebend.
Bymanipulating thetube, hewas
able togetthemercury tostand
atthesame height inbotharms
ofthetube. Thus, heenclosed air
intheshortarmofthetube. This
enclosed airwasatthesame pres-
sure astheoutside atmosphere,
shown onthebarometer tobe29
inches. Boyle thenpoured inmer-
cury until hehadreduced the
volume ofairintheshortarmto
one-half. On measuring the
heights ofthemercury inthetwo
arms, hefound that themercury
inthelonger part ofthetubewas
29inches higher than intheshort-
erarm.The pressure thenhad
been increased from 29inches to
twice 29inches: ithad been
doubled. Itcanbedemonstrated
experimentally thatwhen thepressure isincreased threefold, the
volume oftheenclosed airwillbeone-third; when increased fourfold,
thevolume isdecreased toone-quarter; andsoon.Itshould benoted
thatthetemperature iskeptconstant during these experiments. Boyle’s

volume. Increasing thepressure tofourtimes theoriginal pressure results ina

Solution. Since thenewpressure is oftheoldpressure, andsince
thevolume varies inversely asthepressure, thenewvolume must be

There isnothing unusual inthese numbers orquantities. The
statements “Water is88-88% oxygen and11-11% hydrogen” and
“8unitsbyweight ofoxygen areunited with 1unitbyweight of
hydrogen toform 9unitsbyweight ofwater” have exactly thesame
meaning.
Inthesameway, analyses ofafewcompounds containing hydrogen

Aswithoxygen, acombining weight canbeassigned tohydrogen
andtheproper proportion ofother elements expressed interms ofunits
inproportion tothiscombining weight. Thus, if1unit ofhydrogen is
selected asacombining weight, thefacts presented intheabove table
maybeexpressed asfollows:

(proportion byweight)

Acomparison oftheabove tabulations brings tolight asurprising
fact. Evidently theweights ofthevarious elements that unite with

Fig. 11.2. Gram-equivalent weights ofnine elements. When theelements
reactamong themselves theydosoinproportion tothese weights. Iftheelements
were parcelled asshown, and ifareaction took placebetween anytwoofthem, they
would react sothateach parcel would beusedupcompletely. Thus 12.12 gm.
magnesium would unite completely with 35.5gm.chlorine toform 47.62 gm.mag-
nesium chloride. (N.B. Sometimes theelements react inproportion tosome simple
multiple ofthese weights.)
Every element, with theexception ofafewinert elements, hasbeen
made tounite withsome other elements, butnever with all.Itshould
notbeconcluded thatsuchunion isimpossible. Allthatcanbesaid is
that thishasnotyetbeen accomplished, possibly because theproper
conditions forunion have notbeen discovered todate.Magnesium
andcalcium, forexample, donotcombine, but12-12gm.ofmagnesium
and20gm.ofcalcium willeach liberate 1gm.ofhydrogen from certain
compounds. Ifmagnesium andcalcium weremade tounite under
some asyetunknown conditions, itwould bereasonable toconclude
thattheywould dosointheproportion of12-12 gm. to20gm.,
respectively.
104 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Theweights just established arecalled gram-equivalent weights,
andthenumbers represent theproportions inwhich these elements
would either combine withoneanother orwould replace oneanother.
Thus, ifthevarious elements wereweighed outintheparcels shown in
Fig.11.2 inanyunits ofweight (grams, pounds, ounces, tons, etc.),and
ifthey reacted atalltheywould unite completely, nothing being left
over.What istrue fortheequivalent weights oftheelements selected
here istrue fortheequivalent weights ofallelements. Theequivalent
weight ofanelement could hedefined astheweight ofthatelement that
willcombine with ordisplace 8units byweight ofoxygen,ortheequivalent
weight ofany other element. Toillustrate, theequivalent weight of
chlorine is35-5, ofcarbon 3,ofcopper 3T8,andofhydrogen 1.
Law ofCombining Weights. Thisscheme ofequivalent weights is
notreally assimple ashasbeen shown. Thecompounds used for
illustration were selected toavoid confusion. However, itisnotun-
usual forthesame twoelements tounite toformmore than one
compound. Therefore, some elements havemore thanone“combining”
weight. Forexample, carbon andoxygen formtwocompounds, carbon
dioxide andcarbon monoxide. Incarbon dioxide, 8gm.ofoxygen are
combined with 3gm. ofcarbon; but incarbon monoxide, 8gm. of
oxygen arecombined with 6gm.ofcarbon. Inmercuric andmercurous
oxides, twoquite different oxides ofmercury, 8gm. ofoxygen are
combined with 100gm.and200gm. ofmercury, respectively. Thus
carbon andmercury have atleast twocombining weights. The
simplest combining weights found (those selected inthepreliminary
discussion) aretheequivalent weights. When elements combine toform
compounds,theydosoinproportion tosome simple multiple oftheir
equivalent weights.
When 8gm.ofoxygen unite with 1gm.ofhydrogen, 9gm.ofwater
areformed; andwhen 8gm.ofoxygen unite with20gm.ofcalcium,
28gm.ofcalcium oxide result.When calcium oxide reacts with water,
theproportion byweight ofthetwocompounds is28to9,
respectively. Therefore, 9isanequivalent weight ofwater, and28an
equivalent weight ofcalcium oxide. Compounds, aswellaselements,
have both equivalent weights andcombining weights.
Foreachpure substance (both elements andcompounds), aweight
may beselected such thatwhen these substances enter into chemical
reaction theydosoinproportion tothese weights,orsome simple multiple
ofthem. This isknown astheLaw ofCombining Weights.
Law ofMultiple Proportions. Thecomposition ofcarbon dioxide
andcarbon monoxide illustrate theLaw ofMultiple Proportions. In
these twocompounds, 8unitsbyweight ofoxygen areunited with
LAWSANDTHEORIES OFCHEMICAL COMBINATION 105
3and6unitsbyweight ofcarbon, respectively. These weights of
carbon areinthesimple ratio of1to2.Inmercuric andmercurous
oxides, 8unitsbyweight ofoxygen
areunited with100and200unitsby
weight ofmercury, respectively.
These numbers are also inthe
simple ratio of1to2.Itisevident
that elements may unite inmore
thanoneproportion toform acor-
responding number ofcompounds.
When they do,ifafixed weight of
oneoftheelements hechosen,then
thedifferent weights oftheother ele-
ment which unite with thisfixed
weight, willalways hearasimple
relationship toeach other, i.e.aratio
ofsmall whole numbers. JohnDalton
firstenunciated thislaw in1803.
Another example serves toillus-
trate thisimportant law. Ironand
chlorine formtwocompounds, ferrous and ferric chlorideFig. 11.3. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac
(1778-1850) formulated theLaw of
Gaseous Volumes.
1.Ferrous chloride.... 44-09% iron;55-91% chlorine
2.Ferric chloride 34-46% iron;65-54% chlorine

These weights ofchlorine, 55-91 and83-85 areintheratio of2to3,
and thisratioconforms tothelaw.
Gay-Lussac’s Law ofVolumes. While Dalton wasdeveloping the
Laws ofDefinite andMultiple Proportions, aFrench contemporary,
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, wascarrying outresearches with gases.
Whereas Dalton wasconcerned with combination byweight, Gay-
Lussac wasinterested incombination byvolume. In1781, Cavendish
haddiscovered thatwhen hydrogen andoxygen combine theydoso
intheratio ofapproximately 2to1byvolume. Thisdiscovery intrigued
Gay-Lussac into investigating thevolume relationships inother
gaseous reactions. Hefound that:
(a) 1volume ofhydrogen +1volume ofchlorine >2volumes
ofhydrogen chloride
106 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
(b)1volume ofnitrogen +3volumes ofhydrogen >2volumes
ofammonia
(c) 1volume ofoxygen+2volumes ofcarbon monoxide >2
volumes ofcarbon dioxide
(<d)1volume ofoxygen+2volumes ofhydrogen 2volumes
ofsteam
Allvolumes were measured under corresponding conditions of
temperature and pressure. Gay-Lussac’s investigations ledhim to
formulate thefollowing lawknown astheLaw ofGaseous Volumes
orGay-Lussac’s Law ofVolumes: When gaseous pure substances react,
theydosoinvolumes bearing asimple ratio tooneanother and tothe
volumes oftheproducts {ifthese aregases).
Dalton’s atomic theory. Toexplain thereason fortheLaw of
Conservation ofMass, in1803 Dalton devised thechemical atomic
hypothesis. Hemade thefollowing assumptions:
1.Matter iscomposed ofsmall particles, oratoms, thatcannot be
subdivided byanyknown chemical process.
2.Atoms areindestructible andcannot becreated. They donot
divide when taking part inachemical reaction.
3.Atoms ofthesame element arealike inallrespects, including
weight, andaredifferent fromatoms ofother elements.
4.Atoms possess thepower toattract ortoholdontoother atoms.
5.Compounds areformed bytheunion ofatoms ofdifferent
elements.
6.The“atoms” ofacompound are allalikeandthese“compound
atoms” areformed bythecombination ofatoms ofdifferent kinds.
Dalton’s fundamental ideaswere expressed insuchawaythatthey
became anaccepted working hypothesis. This hypothesis metwith
such success ithassince been elevated totheposition ofatheory.
Notonlydidthetheory explain thereason fortheLaw ofConservation
ofMass butDalton wasalsoabletouse ittopredict theLaw ofDefinite
Proportions andtheLaw ofMultiple Proportions. Helater verified
both lawsbyexperimental methods. Thegreat value ofatheory lies
inthefactthat itenables thescientist topredict what willhappen in
newandasyetuntried situations. Theatomic theory hasbeen agreat
stimulus tothedevelopment ofchemistry. Although modern chemists
have been forced tomodify Dalton’s concepts, there isscarcely any
other lawortheory thathasequally influenced scientific thinking or
ledtosomany discoveries.

Itwillberecalled thatpuresubstances react inproportion totheir

place between oxygen andcarbon monoxide, forexample, thepro-
portion byweight ofthese reacting gases (according tothepreceding
table) would beintheratio ofsome simple multiple of8tosome

Avogadro’s Theory. Theuniformities inthebehaviour ofgases led
anItalian scientist, Amedeo Avogadro, in1811, toenunciate the
following hypothesis, laterknown asAvogadro’s Theory. Equal
volumes ofallgases atthesame temperature andpressure contain thesame
number ofmolecules. Avogadro wasforced tointroduce thisnewword
molecule toovercome misconceptions thathadarisen through trying
tovisualize Dalton’s “compound
atom”. Avogadro recognized two
kinds ofultimate particles, atoms
and molecules. The smallest par-
ticlethatcanexist inafreestate
(e.g.thesmallest particle ofhydro-
gen orofhydrogen chloride) is
called amolecule. The smallest
particle capable oftaking part ina
chemical reaction, orthatcanbe
transferred fromonechemical sub-
stance toanother (e.g.thehydro-
genorchlorine contained inamole-
cule ofhydrogen chloride), is
called anatom.

When molecules areseparated intoatoms andtheatoms regrouped,
achemical change takes place. Molecules ofelements aremade upof
atoms that arealike. Every compound contains atleasttwokinds of
atoms ineach molecule. Asthere arenearly 100elements known, there
arenearly 100kinds ofatoms.
Molecules canbecompared tohouses, andatoms tobricks. In
ordinary chemical reactions the“houses” canbebroken down but
the“bricks” areindivisible. Allchemical action takes place between
theatoms.
Thedecomposition ofwater canberepresented graphically:

Fig. 11.10. Inthediagram each molecule ofwater ismade upoftwoatoms of
hydrogen andoneatom ofoxygen. When water isdecomposed, theatoms arenot
destroyed orchanged inanywaybutaremerely rearranged toformnewsubstances.
Two molecules ofwater, each consisting ofthreeatoms (2ofhydro-
genand 1ofoxygen) change toform 3molecules (2ofhydrogen and
1ofoxygen). Each molecule ofhydrogen contains 2identical atoms,
andthemolecule ofoxygen contains 2identical atoms ofoxygen.
Note that inthechemical reaction illustrated, there hasbeen no
change inthenumber of“bricks”. Elements pass into oroutofcombi-
nation without lossorgain inweight because theatom isnotdivided by
chemical reaction.
In1860, acongress atKarlsruhe tried toclarify theconfusion that
had arisen through amisunderstanding oftheterms “atom” and
“molecule”. Chemists spoke of“atoms ofwater” inthesameway in
which theyspoke of“atoms ofhydrogen”. Avogadro haddied in1856,
LAWSANDTHEORIES OFCHEMICAL COMBINATION 111
blitanother great Italian scientist, Stanislao Cannizzaro (1826-1910),
championed hiscause sosuccessfully that thecongress adopted
Avogadro’s ideas.
Recent investigators have been able tocalculate thenumber of
molecules inagiven volume ofgasandhavefound that22-4 litres of
every gasatS.T.P. contain 6-02X1023molecules. This isknown as
Avogadro' snumber.
Molecular weight. Thevolumes shown inFig. 11.5areequal, but
theratio oftheweights are2to32to44. Ifthese equal volumes
contain thesamenumber ofmolecules, itisevident that ifxmolecules
ofoxygen weigh 32gm.,thenxmolecules ofhydrogen weigh 2gm.,
andxmolecules ofcarbon dioxide weigh 44gm.Therefore asingle
44
molecule ofcarbon dioxide is—times asheavy asasingle molecule of
32
2oxygen, andasingle molecule ofhydrogen is—times asheavy asa
32
single molecule ofoxygen. Hence thenumbers, 32,2,and44represent
therelative weights oftheindividual molecules, andthese numbers
(based onoxygen =32)arecalled molecular weights. There areother
more complex methods ofcomparing molecular weights toodifficult
fordiscussion atthistime. Itshould beemphasized thatmolecular
weights arerelative numbers, whereas gram-molecular weights are
specific weights.
Gram-atomic weights. Consider thegram-molecular weights of
some pure substances containing hydrogen, and findtheamount of
thiselement contained inthegram-molecular weight ineach case.

ofthese elements.
Tofindthegram-atomic weight ofoxygen:
1.List allthecompounds that aregases (orthatcould beobtained
asgases) containing oxygen asconstituent.
2.Find thegram-molecular weight ofeachcompound.
3.Findhowmuch ofthisgram-molecular weight ineachcompound

4.Choose thesmallest weight. This weight would befound tobe

Atomic weight. Ithaspreviously been noted that:
1gm.Hydrogen +35-5gm.Chlorine >36-5gm.Hydrogen chloride
andthat36-5gm. isthegram-molecular weight ofhydrogen chloride,
and36-5 isthemolecular weight. Ifeachmolecule ofhydrogen chloride
weighs 36-5 units, thenanatom ofhydrogen weighs 1unitandan
atom ofchlorine weighs 35-5 units.
If36-5 represents themolecular weight ofhydrogen chloride, then
1and35-5must represent therelative weights oftheatoms ofhydrogen
and chlorine. Thus thenumbers 1,35-5, and16areknown asthe
atomic weights ofhydrogen, chlorine, andoxygen, respectively and
represent therelative weights oftheiratoms. Inasimilar manner the
atomic weights oftheother elements canbedetermined.
Theatomic weights oftheelements arealways related totheatomic
weight ofoxygen,which istaken as16.
There areother more accurate methods ofdetermining atomic
weights.
Thekinetic-molecular theory. Theexistence ofmolecules andatoms
helps thechemist toexplain thebehaviour ofmatter inchemical
reactions. The physicist also relies onthemolecule toexplain many
phenomena notinvolving achemical change.

When alump ofsugar isputintowater, thesugar apparently dis-
appears. Actually thesugar isdistributed through thewater insuch
extremely small particles theycannot beseeneven with theaidofa
microscope. When water isexposed todry air, itevaporates very
rapidly. When apiece ofiron isheated, itexpands. When airisre-
moved from apair ofMagdeburg hemispheres, there isdifficulty in
separating them. Ifapiece ofchalk iscutintwo,andthecutting
process continued longenough, eventually pieces sosmall would be
produced astobenolonger visible even under themost powerful
microscope. Even after thepractical limits ofdivision ofsubstances
havebeen reached, thisprocess could bepictured asgoing onandon.
Theremaining particle becomes smaller witheach division. Could this
supposed division goonforever? There isreason tobelieve that it
could not.
Scientists believe that allmaterial substances arecomposed ofvery
small parts called molecules. Amolecule ofchalk cannot bedivided
and still retain itsidentity aschalk. Furthermore, there isreason tc
believe that themolecules arenotjammed upagainst oneanother,
butareseparated byrelatively large inter-molecular spaces andthat
molecules arealways moving rapidly inthisspace. The difference in
solid, liquid, andgaseous states isthought tobeadifference inth*>
energy ofthemolecules andhence toadifference intheinter-molecula
spaces.
Inthegaseous state, theinter-molecular spaces arevery great;
inliquids, thespaces aresmaller; and insolids, thesmallest ofall.
When there isachange instate (without achemical change), acon-
dition oftemperature, orpressure, orboth, hasoccurred and this
results inachange inthesizeoftheinter-molecular spaces. Thus,
molecules ofliquid water, ice,andsteam arethesame.The difference
instate isadifference inthe“spacing” ofthemolecules and inthe
energy content.
Thephenomena mentioned atthebeginning ofthisdiscussion can
nowbeexplained. The rapidly moving molecules ofasolute would
explain their diffusion through theinter-molecular spaces ofthe
solvent. Themovement ofwater molecules would explain the“escape”
ofsome ofthemwhen water evaporates. Matter expands when heated
because theheatmakes themolecules movemore rapidly andincreases
thesizeoftheinter-molecular spaces. This increases thevolume but
notthemass.When airisremoved from theMagdeburg hemispheres,
themillions ofmolecules ofairoutside thehemispheres continue to
“hammer” from allsides and, asthere arefewmolecules leftinside,
thehemispheres arefirmly pushed together.

shows theratio inwhich theatoms combine, butalsotheweight of
22-4 litres ofthisgasatS.T.P. (i.e.thegram-molecular weight).
Iftheformula ofagas isknown,

Finding simplest formulae. In
order tofindtheformula ofany
compound, either ananalysis orasynthesis must bemade. In
Chapter 9theresults ofananalysis ofmercuric oxide were given, in
which 1-320 gm.ofmercury werecombined with 0-105 gm.ofoxygen
toform 1-425 gm. ofmercuric oxide.
Since 200grams ofmercury arerepresented bythesymbol Hg.,
theweight ofoxygen thatwould unite with 200grams ofmercury
would beFig. 12.4. Jacob Berzelius (1779-

But16gm.ofoxygen canberepresented bythesymbol O.Therefore
thesimplest formula ofmercuric oxide isHgO. Since mercuric oxide
hasnever beenobtained asagas,HgO istheformula used torepresent
acombining weight ofthiscompound.

Finding themolecular formula ofagaseous element. ThesymbolO
represents 1gram-atomic weight, or16gm.ofoxygen, butsinceoxygen
isagas, itsformula must represent theweight of22-4 litres atS.T.P.
Inanexperiment, 186-7 cc.ofoxygen, collected atS.T.P.,werefound
toweigh 0-267 gm.

SinceOrepresents 16gm.ofoxygen, 32gm.would berepresented

Other formulae showing thesame ratio oftheatoms could beS204;

92-3% carbon and7-7% hydrogen. AtS.T.P.,1litre ofthegasweighs
1T61 gm.Find itstrue, ormolecular, formula. (C=12,H=1)

1atom ofcarbon isunited with 1atom ofhydrogen.
Thus thesimplest formula would beCH.Other possible formulae

appr. 26gm.Therefore theformula selected must represent 26gm.,
and thisformula isC2H2.
Alternative solution. Since thecompound isgaseous, theformula
must represent theweight of22-4 litres atS.T.P., which is26gm. It
isknown that100gm.ofthegascontain 92-3gm.carbon and7-7gm.
hydrogen. Therefore, 26gm. ofthegascontain 24gm.carbon and
2gm.hydrogen. Therefore themolecular formula isC2H2.
Percentage composition from aformula. Since theproportion by
weight oftheconstituents must beknown before aformula canbe
given toacompound, itfollows thatwhen theformula isknown to
thechemist, hecan calculate thepercentage composition ofthe
compound.

Potassium chlorate istherefore 31-8% potassium, 29% chlorine,

CHEMICAL EQUATIONS
Uptothis point chemical reactions have been represented by
“word equations”, forexample:
Mercuric oxide >Mercury +Oxygen
Experiments haveshown that216gm.ofmercuric oxide, when heated,
give off200gm. ofmercury and16gm. ofoxygen. This information
canbeexpressed asfollows:
HgO >Hg+O
Inallchemical equations, molecular formulae arerequired for
gaseous pure substances, hence themolecular formula foroxygen, 02,
must beused.Twomolecules ofmercuric oxide arerequired toproduce
onemolecule ofoxygen. Hence theequation iscorrectly written as
follows:
2HgO
2molecules of> 2Hg
2atoms of+ o2
1molecule of

Ifachemical equation istobeofvalue, every detail must becorrect.
Before anequation canbewritten, thefollowing information is
necessary:
1.Thenames ofthereacting substance orsubstances, and the
names ofthesubstance orsubstances formed bythereaction.
2.Theformulae ofallthesubstances involved.
When these facts areknown, a“skeleton” equation canbewritten.
Thesamenumber ofatoms must berepresented oneach side ofa
“balanced equation,” inorder toconform totheLaw ofConservation
ofMass. Thebalancing oftheequation represents asimple problem
inarithmetic. Thus, ifitisknown thatwhen potassium chlorate is
heated, potassium chloride andoxygen areformed, and that the
formula ofpotassium chlorate isKC103,ofpotassium chloride KC1,
andofoxygen 02,then the“skeleton” canbewritten asfollows:
KC103>KC1+02
Thisshows that 122-5 unitsbyweight ofpotassium chlorate decom-
124 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
pose toform 74-5 unitsbyweight ofpotassium chloride, and32units
byweight ofoxygen. Butsince achange intotalweight never occurs
inachemical reaction itisnecessary tobalance theweights asfollows:
Skeleton equation :KC10 3 KC1+02
Balanced equation: 2KC103 y2KC1+302
2KClOs > 2KC1 + 302

Abalanced equation isaconcise statement ofachemical change,
using formulae instead ofwords. Anequation cannot bepredicted. It
canonlybewritten ifthesubstances entering intothereaction and
theproducts formed areknown. Theformulae used ina“skeleton”
equation arefound byexperiment, express facts,andcannot bealtered.
Ifthe“skeleton” equation requires balancing,thenumbers ofmolecules
taking part inthereaction areadjusted.
Rules forwriting chemical equations.
1.From aknowledge ofthefacts, write theword equation.
2.Substitute formulae forwords.
3.Balance theequation.
Consider thechemical reaction resulting whenmagnesium isburned
inoxygen.
Word equation: Magnesium +Oxygen >Magnesium oxide
Skeleton equation: Mg+02 yMgO
Balanced equation: 2Mg+02 y2MgO
Only thebalanced equation canproperly bereferred toasachemical

Valence
Again, things which look toushardanddense must consist ofparticles
hooked together, andtobeheld inunion because compacted throughout
with branch-like elements.
Lucretius
The substitution ofchemical symbols andformulae intheword
equations withwhich wearealready familiar presents certain compli-
cations. What formulae, forexample, willbeused torepresent the
various compounds? Memorization oftheformulae ofthecountless
possible compounds would bevery difficult ifitwere notforaknowl-
edge ofvalence (sometimes called valency) oftheelements they
contain.
Themeaning ofvalence. Theequation forthepreparation ofhydro-
genfrom zincanddilute sulphuric acid is:
Zn-fH2SO 4ZnS0 4-fH2
Here oneatom ofzinc displaces twoatoms ofhydrogen from a
sulphuric acidmolecule. Zinc issaidtohaveavalence oftwoortobe
divalent.
Thefollowing table gives theformulae ofafewcompounds con-
taining hydrogen asaconstituent, theformulae having beenobtained
from experimental data.
HC 1 H20 NH3 CH 4
HBr H2S PH3
Theabove formulae indicate that different elements combine
differently withhydrogen. Oneatom ofchlorine unites withoneatom
ofhydrogen toform amolecule ofhydrogen chloride. Chlorine issaid
tohave avalence ofone, ortobeunivalent. Oneatom ofoxygen,
however, unites withtwoatoms ofhydrogen toform amolecule of
water. Oxygen, therefore, issaidtobedivalent. Similarly nitrogen is
trivalent, andcarbon quadrivalent.
Thevalence ofanyelement represents thenumber ofatoms ofhydrogen
thatwillunite with,orbedisplaced by,oneatom ofthatelement .When
anelement doesnotcombine with, ordisplace, hydrogen, itsvalence
129
130 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
canbedetermined byastudy ofitscombination withsome other
element ofknown valence. Thus, although silver doesnotunite with
hydrogen, itisconsidered univalent because oneatom ofsilver
combines withoneatom ofchlorine toform amolecule ofsilver chloride
(AgCl), andthevalence ofchlorine (asshown inHC1) isone.
Elements with several valences. Some elements unite with others
inmore than oneproportion. There aretwochlorides ofmercury;
mercurous chloride hastheformula HgCl, andmercuric chloride has
theformula HgCl2.Since chlorine hasavalence ofone,mercury in
the firstcompound hasavalence ofone,andinthesecond compound
ithasavalence oftwo.

Using valence. Ifthevalence ofanelement isknown, theinforma-
tioncanbeused towrite notonly theformula ofthecompound
formed when theelement unites withhydrogen, butalsotheformulae
ofthecompounds formed when itunites with other elements. The
valence ofaluminum is3because 1atom ofaluminum willcombine
with 3atoms ofchlorine toform amolecule ofaluminum chloride.
Thealuminum atom canbepictured ashaving three “arms”, or
“couplers”, each ofwhich cancouple with theone“arm” ofa
chlorine atom (Fig. 13.1 [1]).
Theoxygen atom hasavalence of2.Itcanbepictured with 2
“arms”, each grasping the“arm” ofahydrogen atom (Fig. 13.1 [2]).
Fig.13.2 [1]shows that2aluminum atoms areequivalent to6atoms of
chlorine, andFig. 13.2 [2]that 3atoms ofoxygen would beneeded to

“look after” 6atoms ofhydrogen. Therefore, when aluminum and
oxygen unite, theycombine intheproportion of2atoms ofaluminum

to3atoms ofoxygen, andtheformula oftheoxide consequently is
A1203(Fig. 13.2 [3]).Byanalysis, this isfound tobethecorrect formula
ofaluminum oxide.
Fig. 13.2.Twoatoms ofaluminum, 1,canhold sixatoms ofchlorine; three
atoms ofoxygen, 2,canhold sixatoms ofhydrogen. Hence, 3,twoatoms of
aluminum willcombine with threeatoms ofoxygen.
Itwillbenoticed that thenumbers ofatoms oftheelements arein
inverse proportion totheir valences .Ifthis iskept inmind, theformulae
ofmany compounds maybewritten. Iftheformula foraluminum

Itisimportant toremember that valence

Formulae canonly beestablished by
actual analyses.
Inanelementary study ofchemistry,
itiscustomary toaccept theabove con-
cept ofvalence asestablished in1852. Basing valence upon hydrogen
isquite anexcellent procedure, since thehydrogen atom never com-
bines withmore thanoneatom ofanyother element. Thus, ifthe
valence ofhydrogen istaken asone,thevalence ofeach oftheother
elements willofnecessity always beawhole number. (There areno
halfatoms.)
Since 1911, however, scientists have been able toinvestigate the
composition ofmatter tosuchanextent thatwearenow inamuch
better position tounderstand themanner inwhichmany fundamental
reactions andprocesses take place. This isespecially true ofvalence.
One oftheresults ofscientific research isaclearer concept ofthe

tobearranged inavery definite waywith theprotons contained ina
central core, ornucleus, and theelectrons insome characteristic
arrangement outside thenucleus. Theelectrons arebelieved torevolve
about thenucleus inawell-organized pattern ofdefinite paths, or

motion oftheplanets around thesun,they aresometimes referred to
asplanetary electrons.

Many attempts have beenmade torepresent atomic structures
graphically, butnorepresentation isentirely satisfactory. There is
stillsomedoubt astotheexact nature ofthearrangement; moreover,
itisdifficult torepresent athree dimensional structure ontheplane

Itiscustomary tousediagrams similar tothefollowing torepresent

These diagrams aredesigned toillustrate that:
1.The electrons arearranged inrings, shells, ororbits about the
nucleus ofprotons andneutrons.
2.Thehydrogen andsodium atoms arealike inthat they each

There areneutrons present inthenucleus along with theprotons.
Astheneutrons areelectrically neutral andaddonly tothemass of

ment.
Thearrangement ofelectrons isnotcompletely understood. Re-
search hasshown, however, thattheelectrons probably revolve about
thepositively charged nucleus and atdefinite distances from it.
Each electron isconsidered tohave itsownindependent path ororbit.
Most chemists areconvinced that allchemical activity isrelated
directly toelectrons, andthattheelectron theory explains thechemical
properties oftheelements. This explanation isbased ononeortwo
important facts.
134 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
There are sixgases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and
radon), known astheinert gases, and these never enter intoany
chemical combinations. This lack ofchemical activity isexplained on
theassumption that theelectrons ofthese inert elements areso
arranged with eight electrons intheouter shell (except helium which
iscomplete withtwo) astogive theiratoms perfect stability (Fig. 13.6).
Fig. 13.6. The stable atoms ofhelium, neon, andargon. These elements do
notcombine with other elements.
Incontrast, itisassumed that thechemical activity ofalltheother
elements iscaused bythetendency ofeach togain orloseelectrons in
order toacquire thissame perfect stability ofeight electrons inthe
outer shell.
Fig. 13.8shows anelectron configuration foreach ofthe first
eighteen elements.
Thefollowing table gives thenumber ofelectrons inthesuccessive
shells ofthesixinert gases. Inaddition toshowing themaximum
number ofelectrons possible ineach shell, thetableshows thatthere
arenever more than eight electrons intheoutermost shell. Forthis
reason itisusually referred toas“the stable octet structure” ofan
atom.

Electrons may shiftfrom oneatom toanother, andelements tend
either tolend orborrow electrons inorder tomake theouter ringa
complete shell with therequired number ofeight electrons. Itis
obvious thatthesodium atom could very easily lend itssingle electron
VALENCE 135
intheouter ring,andreturn tothesmaller, stable, complete ring
structure ofeight electrons. Likewise thechlorine atom could very
easily borrow asingle electron tocomplete itsouter ring. Actually
this iswhat happens during achemical reaction between sodium and
chlorine. Each sodium atom losesanelectron, andatthesame time
each chlorine atom gains thiselectron. Ifthesodium atom isrepre-
sented bythesymbol Na°, then thesodium atom with itsexcess
positive charge could berepresented byNa+
,andassuch isknown as
thesodium ion(Chapter 16).Likewise thechlorine atom, Cl°,becomes
Cl-andassumes theroleofachloride ion.
Thehydrogen atom, H°,canalsolend itssingle electron tobecome
thehydrogen ionH+
.Since thehydrogen atom hasonlyoneelectron
tolendwecanseewhy itnever combines withmore thanoneatom of
anyother element, andwhy itschoice asastandard ofvalence in1852
wasagood one.
When abivalent metal, likecalcium, gives upelectrons toauni-
valent non-metal likechlorine, themetallic atom canfurnish enough
electrons tocomplete theouter rings oftwochlorine atoms:
Ca°+Cl°+Cl° Ca++CLCL
These ideas ofpositive andnegative ionscannowberelated to
accepted explanations ofvalence.
1.Valence istheword used toexpress thecharge acquired byan
atomwhen itlends orborrows electrons during achemical reaction.
2.When anelement lends electrons, itbecomes electro-positive.
Allelectro-positive elements actasmetals.
3.When anelement borrows electrons, itbecomes electro-negative
Allelectro-negative elements actasnon-metals.

Itisevident that theinverse rule ofvalence isthesame asthat
given above. Butwith electrovalence theelement giving upthe
electrons isshown ashaving apositive valence rather than justhaving
avalence. Theelement that receives theelectron isshown ashaving
anegative valence.
Variable valences arealso quite easily explained when atomic
structures arestudied inmore detail. Atpresent, itissuggested that
theelectrovalences beaccepted andlearned without question. How-
ever,when discrepancies seem toappear inthefurther study of
chemistry, remember that theusual conduct ofatoms hasbeen re-

CHAPTER 14
Naming Compounds
Language istheonlyinstrument ofscience, andwords arebutthe
signs ofideas.
Samuel Johnson
Every branch ofscience hasapertinent system ofnomenclature
involving adefinite vocabulary which anystudent must master in
order tounderstand thesubject. Biology’s system ofnaming and
classification greatly simplifies thestudy ofplants andanimals. Plants
aredivided intophyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species,
andacommon language isnecessary innaming them. Thus thename
Quercus immediately calls tomind thegenus ofplants commonly
known as“theoaks”. Theaddition oftheword albasuggests thewhite
oak,oneofthespecies ofthegenus Quercus. Quercus alba isthe
name ofthewhite oak.
Nomenclature inchemistry. Before Lavoisier’s time, there was
nothing systematic about thewaycompounds werenamed. Astrology
andalchemy wenthand inhand soclosely thattheinfluence ofthe
astrologer isevident inthenames ofsomecompounds such aslunar
caustic, andcrocus martis. Mercuric oxide, madebyoneprocess, was
called “mercurius calcinatus perse”,andwhen produced byanother
method itwas called “red precipitate”. Such asystem must have
resulted inconfusion, tosaynothing ofthestrain onthememory.
Lavoisier began thesystematic system ofnomenclature used today.
Thenames ofmany oftheelements havebeengiven inChapter 12.
Thesystem ofnaming compounds isdesigned tosupply information
concerning thesubstances involved. Thename ofacompound often
tellsthenames oftheconstituent elements. This information, coupled
with aknowledge ofvalence, canbeused towrite apossible formula
with allthat itimplies. Thenomenclature ofchemistry is,inthis
respect, superior tothenaming method used inany oftheother
sciences.
Theuseof“-ide”. When acompound consists oftwoelements, its
name ends in“-ide”. Thus zincchloride refers toacompound ofzinc
andchlorine. Applying aknowledge ofvalence, thechemist establishes
itsformula asZnCl 2.Innaming compounds oftwoelements (binary

bromides, iodides, andsulphides areexamples ofcompounds inthis
group.
“Peroxides’ ’such ashydrogen peroxide (H202),sodium peroxide
(Na 202),andbarium peroxide (Ba02)areunusual oxides possessing

oxide. Iftheformulae ofthethree peroxides listed berewritten as

apparent.
Theuseof“-ous” and“-ic”.When twoelements unite indifferent
proportions toformtwodifferent compounds, thesuffixes “-ous” and
“-ic” areused todistinguish these compounds. The suffix “-ous” de-
notes thelower valence. Since mercury hasthetwovalences, oneand
two,mercur ousoxide would bethename ofthecompound whose
formula isHg20.andmercuric oxide would bethename ofthecom-

thisreason they areknown asoxy-acids. Theproperties distinguishing

combine toform fouroxy-acids. These with their formulae are:
Chloric acid HC103
Chlorous acid HC10 2
Hypochlorous acid HCIO

Thefollowing system ofnaming issometimes usedwhenever there is
more thanoneoxy-acid containing thesame three elements. Themost
important acid, ortheone firstdiscovered, isnamed the“-ic” acid.
When there isoneoxygen atom lessinthemolecule than inthe“-ic”
acid, thesuffix “-ous” issubstituted intheacidname. Ifthere aretwo
oxygen atoms fewer inthemolecule than inthe“-ic” acid, theprefix
“hypo” isused along with thesuffix “-ous”, e.g.hypochlorous acid.
Ifthere isoneatom ofoxygen permolecule more than inthe“-ic”
acid, theprefix “per-” isused along with thesuffix “-ic”. Thus the
importance ofmemorizing theformulae ofthe“-ic” acids isnow
apparent. HN0 2istheformula ofnitrous acid, andH2S0 3the
formula ofsulphurous acid.However, thesystem outlined above does
notalways apply accurately, e.g. itcould notapply innaming the
thirteen oxy-acids ofsulphur.

similarity: H2S0 4,ZnS0 4,Na 2S0 4,CaS0 4,CuS0 4,PbS0 4,A12(S0 4)3,
BaS0 4,K2S0 4,MgS0 4.
Ineach oftheabove compounds, thesulphur andoxygen atoms are

aresuffixed -ate. Radicals from “-ous” acids aresuffixed “-ite”,
e.g.thesulphite radical (SO3) isderived from H2SO3.
Learning theacidradicals andtheir valences presents little difficulty
once the “-ic” acids and thesystem ofnomenclature have been
memorized. Here areafewofthem.

Thenaming ofsalts isdealt withmore fully inChapter 16.
Other radicals. Nitrogen andhydrogen occur intheproportion of
onetofouratoms, respectively, inmany compounds. NH 4CIisthe
formula ofammonium chloride. Because theradicalNH 4behaves like
ametal inthat itreplaces metals andhydrogen inmany reactions,
likemetals itisgiven aname ending in“um”. Since chlorine hasa
valence ofone(HC1), thevalence oftheammonium radical isone
(NH4CI).
Hydroxides contain theradicalOHhaving avalence ofoneand
called thehydroxyl radical. Thus, theformula forsodium hydroxide
isNaOH. Othercommon hydroxides arepotassium hydroxide (KOH),
calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2),andammonium hydroxide (NH 4OH).
Note thatsomeammonium and allhydroxide compounds, although

Using Equations
...Nature’s great book iswritten inmathematical language.

Every manufacturer isvitally concerned notonly with thekinds
ofrawmaterials usedandthefinished products obtained, butalso
with therelative quantities, andhence with therelative costs ofraw
and finished goods. Ifthechemist istodoanyquantitative work in
thelaboratory, orinchemical industry, herequires acomplete under-
standing oftheprocesses involved, and acommand ofchemical
equations andcalculations. There isnofumbling orguessing inthe
chemical industry. Every chemical equation represents inconcise
form, both qualitatively andquantitatively, facts learned byexperi-
ment, having reference tothechanges undergone and totherelative
quantities ofthematerials involved. Equations donotusually indicate
whether thereaction isendothermic orexothermic, whether acatalyst
hasbeen used, orwhat kind ofapparatus ortreatment isnecessary.
However, equations doexpress therelative quantities ofthereacting
substances andmake possible thecalculation oftheproportions by
weight andbyvolume ofthesubstances involved.
Calculating relative weights. Thedecomposition ofmercuric oxide
byheat isrepresented bythefollowing equation:
2HgO *2Hg+02

Thenumbers shown under theequation may represent grams,
ounces, pounds, oranyother units ofweight. Toprepare 400pounds
ofmercury would require 432pounds ofmercuric oxide; toprepare
onehalf ofthisamount ofmercury, viz.200pounds, would require

Solving weight-volume problems. Problems frequently involve both
weights andvolumes.
Problem. What volume ofhydrogen, collected atS.T.P., could be
produced from 130gm.zinc?
Solution.
Zn+2HC1 >ZnCl2+H2
65gm.+73gm. 136gm.+2gm.(or22-4 1.atS.T.P.)
Insolving thisproblem, theG.M.V. (22-4 1.atS.T.P.) isselected
rather than theG.M.W. (2gm.) because theproblem asks fora
volume ofhydrogen.
65gm.zinc liberate 22-4 1.ofhydrogen atS.T.P.
130gm.zinc liberate 44-8 1.ofhydrogen atS.T.P.
Problem. What volume ofoxygen at10°C.and740mm. pressure
could beobtained from 49gm.potassium chlorate?
Solution. 2KCIO3*2KC1+302

49gm.potassium chlorate give X67-2=13-44 1.oxygen (S.T.P.)

Volume ofoxygen at273°A.and760mm. is13-44 litres.
Volume ofoxygen at283°A.and740mm. is

Solving volume problems. Problem, (a)What volume ofoxygen
would beneeded forthecomplete combustion of44-8 1.hydrogen,
both gases measured atS.T.P.?(b)What volume ofoxygen atany
temperature andpressure would berequired forthecomplete com-
bustion of20quarts ofhydrogen measured atthesame temperature
andpressure?
Solution, (a) 2H2-f-02—>2H20

(S.T.P.) (S.T.P.)
44-8 1.hydrogen atS.T.P. require 22-4 1.oxygen atS.T.P.
(b)Thevolume relationship (2:1)intheabove equation
could apply toother units ofvolume than litres, andtoother con-
ditions oftemperature andpressure ifboth gases aremeasured atthe
same temperature andpressure.
Hence 2volumes ofhydrogen require 1volume ofoxygen ifboth
aremeasured atthesame temperature andpressure.
And20quarts ofhydrogen would require 10quarts ofoxygen if
both aremeasured atthesame temperature andpressure.

CHAPTER 16
Ionization, Acids, Bases, and Salts
Thetheory thatcanabsorb thegreatest number offacts, andpersist
indoing so,generation after generation, through allchanges ofopinion
and detail, istheonethatmust rule allobservation.
JohnWeiss
The electron theory explains electro valence. Italsoaccounts for
theformation ofpositive andnegative ionsandthese inturn explain
thebehaviour ofmetals andnon-metals inchemical reactions. How-
ever, thetheory ofionization wasformulated longbefore themodern
electron theory.
Anelectric current willpassthrough some solutions butnotthrough
others. Solutions ofsulphuric acid, sodium hydroxide, andsodium
chloride, forexample, are allexcellent conductors ofelectricity,
whereas distilled water isanon-conductor, andalcohol andsugar
(either intheir pure state orinsolution) donotconduct anelectric
current.
IONIZATION
Toexplain these differences inconductivity, Michael Faraday
(1791-1867) incorrectly assumed that the electric current caused
some substances tobreak upinto electrified parts thathecalled ions.
Substances forming ions, hesaid,would conduct electricity, andsub-
stances notforming ionswould notconduct electricity. Theformer he
called electrolytes andthelatter non-electrolytes. This theory did
notsatisfy aSwedish student, Svante Arrhenius, because itfailed to
explain many reactions taking place insolution. Aftermany years of
study andexperimentation, Arrhenius, in1887, proposed what is
known today astheionization theory orthetheory ofelectrolytic
dissociation. Hebelieved that electrolytes dissociated insolution
before theelectric current waspassed through them, andthattheions
were notcaused bytheelectric current butthat their existence could
explain theconductivity ofsolutions.
Arrhenius’ theory ofionization. Following isasummary ofthe
ionization theory.
153
154 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
1.Electrolytes dissociate insolution toform electrified particles
called ions.
2.Two kinds ofionsareformed bythisdissociation: positive and
negative ions.
3.Thenumber ofpositive charges isalways equal tothenumber
ofnegative charges ontheions, sothatthesolution ofanyelectrolyte
isalways electrically neutral.
Some electrolytes canbemelted, and inthemolten state, without
thepresence ofwater, they willionize andconduct anelectric current.
Thenature ofanion.When sodium andchlorine combine toform
sodium chloride, eachsodium atom (Na°) losesanelectron andbe-
comes asodium ion(Na+
),andeach chlorine atom (Cl°) gains an
electron andbecomes achloride ion(Cl-
).Sodium chloride isasolid
and inthis state theions areheld infairly rigid position bytheir
electrical attraction. If,however, sodium chloride isdissolved inwater,
itsionsbecome freely mobile.
NaCl—^Na++Cl-
Theabove equation shows that solidsodium chloride forms two
ions,oneasodium ionwith apositive charge, andtheother achloride
ionwith anegative charge.
Ifanelectric current ispassed through thissolution, theions will
move under theinfluence oftheelectrical charges ontheelectrodes.
Amolecule ofsulphuric acid, inionizing, forms twohydrogen ions,
each with apositive charge, andonesulphate ionwithtwonegative
charges.
H2S0 4—>2H++S0 4--
Although sulphuric acidforms twice asmany positive asnegative
ions, thenumbers ofpositive andnegative charges arethesame, so
thatasolution ofsulphuric acid iselectrically neutral. Note alsothat
anion isnotnecessarily acharged atom, but itmay consist ofagroup
ofatoms (e.g.SO4 ).
ELECTROLYSIS
The electrolysis ofwater with theformation ofhydrogen andoxygen
hasalready been described. This chemical reaction, together with
thepartsulphuric acidplays init,cannowbeexplained byreference
tothetheory ofionization.
Inwater solution, sulphuric acid ionizes togivehydrogen ions
andsulphate ions (seeabove). When anelectric current ispassed
IONIZATION, ACIDS, BASES, ANDSALTS 155
through thissolution, thehydrogen ionsmove towards thenegatively
charged cathode, andthesulphate ionsmove towards thepositively
charged anode.
Inaddition tothehydrogen ionsandthesulphate ionsthere area

tion ofwater (p.214).

Atthecathode, each positively charged hydrogen iongains anelectron

Thehydrogen atoms thencombine inpairs toformhydrogen molec-
ules. These molecules accumulate and riseasbubbles ofhydrogen
gasfrom thecathode surface.
H°+H°—^H2
Attheanode, there isacompetition between thesulphate ionand
thehydroxyl ion. Both ofthese ionsarenegatively charged andhave
atendency togiveuptheir electrons. However, thehydroxyl ionhas
amuch greater tendency togiveupelectrons than hasthesulphate
ion (p.215). Hence eachhydroxyl iongivesupitscharge (loses an
electron) tobecome aneutral hydroxyl group.OH—k

Thesulphuric acidproduces asolution which conducts thecurrent
wellenough toproduce theelectrolysis ateach electrode.
Acids, bases and salts, arethree types ofcompounds whose aqueous
solutions aregood electrolytes. These willnowbestudied indetail.
15b CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
ACIDS
Occurrence. Acids arefound innature inthejuices ofmany fruits.
Citrus fruits such aslemons, oranges, andgrapefruits, contain citric
acid,andmost unripe fruits such asapples, peaches, andplums are
also acidic. Thestems andleaves ofsome plants, e.g.rhubarb, also
contain acids that givethem their characteristic sour taste. Infact
theword acidcomes from aLatin word acidus meaning sour.
Baker Chemical Company
Fig. 16.1. The bottle containing thehydrofluoric acid ismade ofthe plastic
polyethylene. Oxalic acid isasolid.
Bacteria cause thefermentation offresh milk toproduce acurdy
mixture with asour taste caused bythepresence oflactic acid.The
fermentation of“hard” apple ciderbybacterial action produces an-
other acid,named acetic acid, found inthecider vinegar soformed.
Carbonic acidandother organic acids arefound inallnatural
waters, particularly where plant oranimal remains havedecomposed.
Preparation. Acids canbeprepared bythereaction between acidic
oxides {acid anhydrides)
andwater.

Ineach case theacidformed isseparated from thereacting sub-
stances bymethods based ondifferences inboiling points. Themanu-
facture ofsulphuric acid willbedescribed later. Sometimes anacid
canbeprepared bydirect union oftheelements, e.g.chlorine and
hydrogen willunite directly toformhydrogen chloride.
Properties. There aremany thousands ofknown acids.Some ofthese
aresolids, some liquids, andafewaregases atordinary temperatures.
During theelectrolysis ofanyacid solution, hydrogen gas isalways
produced atthecathode, while theproduct orproducts obtained at
theanode, depend ontheacidelectrolysed. Thesource ofthehydrogen
gas isthehydrogen ion,H+
,andtherefore allacids contain hydrogen
ions. Indeed, some authorities gosofarastodefine thehydrogen ion
as“theonlyacid” because theproperties usually attributed toacids
areinreality theproperties ofthehydrogen ion.
Inaddition tocontaining thehydrogen ion, allacids inwater solution
have thefollowing properties:
1.They have asour taste.
2.They affect indicators: (a)blue litmus isturned red,(b)pink
phenolphthalein isturned colourless, and(c)neutral (green) brom-
thymol blue isturned yellow.
3.They react withsome metals (seeactivity table, Chapter 6)to
formhydrogen andasalt.
4.They react with theoxides ofmetals toform saltsandwater, e.g.
CuO+H2S0 4>CuS0 4+H20
5.Allsolutions ofacids neutralize bases.
6.Acids react with carbonates orbicarbonates toliberate carbon
dioxide gas.
Strength. The strength ofanaciddepends upon thedegree of
ionization, ortheconcentration ofthehydrogen ions,when theacid
isdissolved inwater. Hydrochloric acid isabetter conductor of
electricity andhasgreater chemical activity than acetic acidsolution
because itismore completely ionized than acetic acid. Nitric and
sulphuric acids arealsohighly ionized insolution. Acids giving ahigh
concentration ofhydrogen ionsarecalled strong acids. Thefollowing
strong acids are listed inorder ofstrength: hydrochloric, nitric,
sulphuric, andphosphoric. Weak acids arepoor ionizers, e.g.acetic,
carbonic, andhydrosulphuric. Concentration and strength ofacids
should notbeconfused. Aconcentrated acidsolution contains ahigh
percentage oftheacidmolecules notnecessarily freely ionizing; thus
aconcentrated solution ofacetic acid isnotasstrong asadilute solution
ofhydrochloric acid.
158 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
BASES
Atypical base. Bases donotcommonly occur innature and are,
therefore, probably notasfamiliar asacids.When sodium reacts with
water, hydrogen andacompound called sodium hydroxide areformed.
Sodium hydroxide isatypical base.Most metals react withoxygen
Baker Chemical Company

toform metallic oxides. Theoxides ofsome metals react withwater
toform hydroxides, e.g.
Na20+H20>2NaOH
When ametallic hydroxide, nomatter howformed, isdissolved in
water, itdissociates togive metallic ionsandhydroxyl ions.
NaOH >Na++OH~
Theproperties usually attributed tobases areinreality theproper-
tiesofthehydroxyl ion.Hence thehydroxyl ionmaybeconsidered
as“theonly base”.
Properties. Inaddition tocontaining thehydroxyl ion, allbases in
water solution have thefollowing properties.
1.They have abitter taste.
2.They feelslippery andsoapy tothetouch.
3.They affect indicators:(a)redlitmus isturned blue,(b)colour-
lessphenolphthalein isturned pink, and (c)neutral (green) brom-

Alkalis. Bothsodium hydroxide andpotassium hydroxide arevery
soluble inwater, andboth dissociate freely togive large quantities of
hydroxyl ions.These twostrong bases that exhibit marked chemical
activity, including caustic andcorrosive actions, arecalled alkalis. The
preparation oflyeorcaustic soda isdescribed inChapter 23.
Other bases. Calcium hydroxide, commonly called slaked lime, is
butsparingly soluble inwater, and itssolution, called limewater, is
notasstrongly basic asarethesolutions ofsodium andpotassium
hydroxides. Itischeaply made bythereaction between quicklime
andwater.Ammonium hydroxide isanimportant, although weakand
unstable base. Itismadeby“dissolving” ammonia gasinwater and
exists only insolution. Efforts toevaporate thissolution toobtain
pureammonium hydroxide result only intheunstable compound
decomposing.
NH 4OH—nh3+h2o
Forthisreason, ammonium hydroxide issometimes called thevolatile
base.
NEUTRALIZATION
When solutions ofanybaseandanyacidaremixed inthecorrect
proportions, thedistinctive properties ofboth disappear, andasalt
andwater areproduced. Asaresult ofthisreaction, each issaidto
neutralize theother.
NaOH+HC1 >NaCl+H20

Inthereaction represented bytheabove equation, solutions of
sodium hydroxide andhydrochloric acidproduce aneutral solution of

solution aremixed withasolution containing 36-5 unitsbyweight of
hydrogen chloride, theresulting solution willcontain 18additional
unitsbyweight ofwater, and58*5unitsbyweight ofsaltandwillnot
showanycharacteristic properties ofeither abaseoranacid. Neutral-
ization may bedefined asthereaction ofanacidwithabase toform
waterandasalt. Allneutralization reactions areexothermic.
160 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Other examples ofneutralization are:
2KOH +H2S0 4— 2H20+K2S0 4(asalt)
Ca(OH) 2+2HN0 3—>2H20+Ca(N03)2(asalt)
Mg(OH) 2+H2C03—>2H20+MgC03(asalt)
NH4OH 4-HC1—>H20+NH4C1(asalt)
Aknowledge ofneutralization isuseful inmany situations. The
destructive effect ofacidburns canbeminimized byaprompt appli-
cation ofaweak base, oriftheburn hasbeencaused byanalkali, the
effect canbeneutralized bytheapplication ofaweak acidsuch as
vinegar. When material hasbeen treated withanacid inindustry, the
excess acid isoften “destroyed” withaweak base; anexcess ofbase is
removed bytreatment withaweak acid.Acid soils, useless forgrowing
most crops, are“sweetened” bytheaddition ofslaked lime.
SALTS
Asalt isacompound formed bythereplacement ofallorpart of
theavailable hydrogen ofanacidmolecule byeither ametal oran
electro-positive radical (e.g.ammonium). Salts arecomposed ofthe
positive part ofabaseandthenegative part ofanacid.
Itisalmost impossible tolistthegeneral properties ofsaltsbecause
they crystallize insomany different solid geometric forms andshow
suchmarked variations insolubilities. Their colours alsovary widely,
e.g.common salt iswhite, copper sulphate (hydrate) isblue,potassium
permanganate isdark purple, andleadiodide isyellow.

Soluble saltsmayoccur inregions where there islittle rainfall, orin
underground deposits protected bylayers ofimpervious rocks. Some
ofthese arecommon salt, Chile saltpetre, potassium chloride, and
magnesium sulphate.
Although many salts used commercially occur innature, many
thousands areprepared bythechemist.

salts, acid salts, and basic salts.
When ametal (ortheammonium
radical) replaces alltheavailable
hydrogen ofanacid molecule, a
normal salt isformed (e.g.sodium
sulphate, Na 2S04).Anacid salt
may beconsidered asformed by
thepartial neutralization ofanacid
byabase, i.e.only part ofthe
available hydrogen inthe acid
molecule hasbeen replaced (e.g
sodium bisulphate, NaHS0 4).A
basic saltmay alsobeconsidered

However, impurities, insmall quantity, willcolour itred, blue, or

Diamonds arefound chiefly inSouth Africa which yields90% of

pebbles embedded inblue clay deposits inthenecks ofextinct vol-
canoes. They occur also inBrazil, India, andtheBelgian Congo.
The rarity andthebeauty ofadiamond explain itsvalue asagem.
With anindex ofrefraction of2-47, thegreatest refractive index of
anyknown substance, andcutbyexperts sothat itssurface ismade
ofmany light-reflecting facets, thediamond shines with unusual
brilliance. Gems aresoldbyweight, andtheunit ofweight, thecarat,
isequal to200 milligrams. The
industrial value ofdiamonds is
even greater than theirornamental

makes them valuable ascutting

sary inexploring the possibilities
ofamining area. Diamonds are
alsoused incutting glassand for
drawing wire toafinethread. The
metal filament inanelectric lamp
ismade bydrawing wirethrough a
diamond die.
Graphite. What acontrast todia-
mond istheform ofcarbon called
graphite! Graphite, likediamond,
iscrystalline, but itsgrayish-black
crystals areinvery thin plates. The
crystals aresosoftand slippery
they slide over oneanother with
very little friction, thusmaking
graphite anexcellent lubricator.
Graphite isevenmore resistant tochemical action thandiamond,
andmelting itisalmost impossible. This inactivity makes graphite
auseful ingredient instove polish andacid-proof paints. Even atex-
tremely high temperatures, graphite isnotoxidized toanyextent.
This quality renders itvaluable inmanufacturing crucibles employed
inthemelting ofmetals. Graphite isagoodconductor ofelectricity.
This quality, coupled with itsinactivity andhighmelting point, makes
ituseful aselectrodes inelectric furnaces andarclamps Theonly pro-
duct ofthecombustion ofburned graphite iscarbon dioxide. Theword
“graphite” comes from theGreek graphein meaning “towrite”.
Graphite, mixed with clayandbaked, becomes the“lead” oflead

Amorphous carbon. Theword“amorphous” means without definite
shape, hence notcrystalline. Recent investigations withX-rays have
shown that theso-called amorphous forms ofcarbon arecomposed of
microscopic crystals something likethecrystals ofgraphite. The
principal amorphous forms, which arenever quite pure, arecharcoal,
coke, boneblack, carbon black, andgascarbon.
Charcoal. Ifwood isheated insuch away that air isexcluded,
charcoal isformed. Wood isamixture ofmany compounds, mostly
made upofcarbon, hydrogen andoxygen.
168 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Heating thewood outofcontact with aircauses chemical reactions
totake place with theresultant breaking down ofthewood into
simpler substances ofwhich charcoal isone.Some ofthese substances
canbeseparated bycondensation. Destructive distillation isthe
decomposition ofacomplex substance, heated outofcontact with air,
andthecondensation ofthevolatile products. Strongly heated wood
gives offmany gases.When cooled, some ofthese gases condense to
formwood tarandawatery distillate known intheindustry as
pyroligneous acid.Wood tar isused topreserve wood. Thewatery
distillate isamixture ofwater, acetic acid, acetone, andwood alcohol.
Thegases thatdonotcondense areinflammable, andcanbeused to
heat theretorts containing thewood. They areamixture ofcarbon
monoxide, hydrogen, acetylene, methane, andsome carbon dioxide.
Wood charcoal isablack, amorphous substance containing thesalt
impurities found inwood. Because ofitsporous nature, itfloats on
water. When theair isexpelled from itbykeeping itimmersed for
some time inboiling water, thecharcoal, with aspecific gravity of

Activated charcoal. Activated charcoal ismade byheating charcoal
inacurrent ofsteam toremove alltarry impurities andgases, and
then cooling itinavacuum. Such charcoal hasgreat adsorbing
properties forgases anddissolved substances. Adsorption should be
distinguished from absorption. Inabsorption,theliquid completely

ofblotting paper onink.Inadsorp-
tion,thepores arenot filled, e.g.in

effect. Activated charcoal, made
from compact substances such as
cocoanut shells, peach, plum, or
prune pits, ismuch more efficient
forthispurpose than thatmade
fromwood. The finer thegrade of
charcoal, themore numerous the
pores, andhence thegreater the
surface area. Activated charcoal,
when used ingasmasks, will
adsorb themost poisonous gases.
Sometimes other chemicals are
added tomake themask more
efficient. Charcoal isalsoused to
adsorb thefoul-smelling gasesfrom
sewers ordecaying flesh.
Boneblack. The destructive dis-
tillation ofbones leaves aporous
residue ofboneblack, oranimal
charcoal, that isonlyabout15%
carbon. Bone oilandpyridene are
by-products found inthedistillate.
Large quantities ofboneblack areused inrefining sugar. Hot,brown,
impure sugar solution ispoured through boneblack inlarge filters.
Thecolouring matter isadsorbed bytheboneblack, andfrom the
clear solution, emerging asafiltrate, white sugar crystals areobtained.
Coke.Thedestructive distillation ofsoftcoal results inmany gases
being given offandtheresidue remaining iscoke. Industrially, soft
coal isdestructively distilled inhuge iron retorts. When themixture
ofemitted gases iscooled, coal tarandother oilyproducts condense.U.S.Bureau ofMines

“gascarbon”, isalsoobtained from thewalls oftheretorts. Thiscan
bepressed into sticks andused forelectrical purposes. Positive
electrodes ofdry cells areusually made from thisform ofcarbon.
Carbon black. Carbon black isthemost finely divided substance
known tocommerce, andthemost intensely black. Each particle is
sosmall itmust bemagnified 35,000 times toequal the size ofa
pinhead.
Carbon black isproduced bytwomain processes, thechannel
method, andthefurnace method, each ofwhich involves thepartial
burning ofhydrocarbons inasupply ofairinsufficient forcomplete
combustion. Theexpensive channel method employs natural gasand
produces afiner quality of“blacks”, used principally forprinting
inks, paints, lithographic inks, carbon paper, andtypewriter ribbons.
Most ofthecarbon black produced bythismethod comes fromTexas
where natural gas isabundant. Asingle plantmay consist ofmore
than ahundred burner sheds stretched along anarea50miles long
and5miles wide. Insuch aplant fivemillion flames burndayandnight
from fan-shaped burner tipsplaced only afewinches apart. Above
theburners arerows ofsteel plates, orchannels, 8inches wideand
140feet long.Theluminous flames deposit layers ofcarbon onthe
cool steel, andtheslow, backandforthmovement ofthechannels
results intheirwhole surface being covered. Stationary scrapers clean
thecarbon from thechannels, and itdrops tohoppers where acon-
veyor system moves ittothepacking house.
Thefurnace method consists essentially ofacombustion chamber,
acooling tower, anelectrical precipitator, and several cyclone col-
lectors. Natural gas isburned with alittle airinthecombustion
chamber, andthehotgases, carrying thecarbon black insuspension,
arecooled andpassed totheprecipitator where the“black” isde-
posited. Thismethod isflexible andtherefore permits theproduction
oftheseveral varieties of“blacks” required byindustry.
Foreasy handling, toreduce thespace itoccupies, toprevent
contamination oftheatmosphere, and tomake itflowmore easily,
carbon black ispelletized intotinybeads that disintegrate very easily
butarestrong enough topour likebuckshot without creating adust
nuisance.
Inaddition toinks, paints, andlacquers, carbon black isnowused
inblackboards, metal polishes, fireworks, explosives, cosmetics,
crayons, tarpaulins, waterproof sheeting, clothing, leather, paper, and
even insome food preparations. However, 95% ofallcarbon black

made isused intherubber industry. Carbon black, intherough pro-
portion of40%byweight ofthecrude rubber, greatly increases the
lifeandmileage oftires,andprevents damage byoilandhardening in
coldweather. More than abillion pounds ofcarbon black arepro-
duced annually.

bustion ofoils,thecarbon depositing assoot inaseries ofchambers.
Itisused intheproduction ofprinters’ inkandblack paint.
Allotropy. Many elements, among them carbon, sulphur, phos-
phorus, andoxygen, can exist intwoormore forms with different
physical, andalmost identical chemical properties. These forms are
known asallotropes andtheelements existing inthese forms aresaid
toexhibit allotropy.
Diamond andgraphite aretheonly allotropes ofcarbon. Ifone
gram ofeither diamond orgraphite isburned, exactly 3-67gm. of
carbon dioxide areproduced. In1893, Moissan dissolved graphite in
molten iron inanelectric furnace (3,000° C.),andrapidly cooled the
iron inmolten lead.When theouter layer ofironthat resulted was
dissolved inhydrochloric acid,many very small diamonds were dis-
covered. Ifadiamond isheated outofcontact with air, itisconverted
into graphite. This isanother characteristic ofallotropes, viz.each
canbechanged intotheother form withnochange inweight. The
differences inproperties ofallotropes ispossibly caused bythedif-
ference inthearrangement oftheatoms inthemolecule.
Oxygen exists intwo forms. One ofthese iscalled oxygen
(formula 02),and theother, ozone (formula 03).Ozone canbe
formed fromoxygen bypassing anelectrical discharge through airor
oxygen, orbyexposing oxygen toultra-violet light.
302—>203
Ozone hasapeculiar, pungent odour, sometimes noticeable after a
thunder storm. Itisabetter andmore effective oxidizing agent than
oxygen.
CARBON DIOXIDE
Occurrence. Itmight beimagined that theenormous quantities of
carbon dioxide used inphotosynthesis would result inadeficiency of
thisgasintheair.This, however, isnotthecase, because large quanti-
tiesofcarbon dioxide arebeing continuously restored totheairby
thebreathing activities ofanimals and plants, bytheburning of
carbonaceous matter, andbythenatural decomposition ofanimal
andplant remains. Thus abalance ismaintained, andtheproportion
CARBON AND ITSCOMPOUNDS 173
ofcarbon dioxide intheairremains approximately 3parts inten
thousand. Carbon dioxide isgiven offbyvolcanoes, and itisalsofound
insmall quantities insome natural gases.
Carbon dioxide isalso present insolution inallnatural waters;
infact itisdifficult toprepare water entirely freefrom it.Thepresence
ofcarbon dioxide innatural waters makes possible thegreen plant
lifefound therein, andwhich inturn isessential toallother aquatic life.

Preparation. About 1752, aScottish chemist, Joseph Black, proved
thatexpired airwasnotmerely inspired airdeficient inoxygen, but
contained a“new” gashenamed fixed air.Later, byheating chalk
(aform ofcalcium carbonate) very intensely, heproduced thesame
gaswhich herecognized bypassing itthrough limewater andobserving
thesame milky appearance visible when expired airwas similarly
tested. Lavoisier, using thescientific method (Chapter 3),proved this
gasacompound ofcarbon andoxygen.
Carbon dioxide canbeprepared infivedifferent ways: byburning
carbon orsubstances containing carbon;bydecomposing acarbonate
byheat;bytheaction ofanacidonacarbonate; byrespiration; and
byfermentation.
The usual laboratory method forpreparing carbon dioxide isby
theaction ofanacidoneither acarbonate orabicarbonate (Fig. 17.8):

Uses. The properties mentioned above suggest many important
uses. Because carbon dioxide isdenser than airanddoesnotsupport
combustion, itisgood forsmothering fires.One ofthemostmodern
fireextinguishers isaheavy metal tank filled with liquid carbon
dioxide. When thevalve onthetank isopened, theliquid carbon
dioxide vaporizes. Thevaporization, requiring heat, cools theissuing
vapour andsublimes ittocarbon dioxide “snow” that descends in
asmothering cloud around the fire.Anairport crash truck, equipped
with these extinguishers, candischarge atonofcarbon dioxide ona
burning plane inafewminutes. Liquid carbon dioxide can also
extinguish fires inthemotors ofaeroplanes inflight. Another modern
fireextinguisher effective onoilorgasoline firesmakes useofsodium
bicarbonate powder that hasbeen treated toprevent caking. The
powder isstored inheavy steel cylinders fromwhich itisexpelled on
the firebycarbon dioxide gasliberated from acartridge inthehead
ofthecylinder. Thepowder, onbecoming heated inthe fire,liberates
carbon dioxide and thissmothers theflame.Toextinguish small fires
inordinary combustible materials such aswood, paper, rubbish, etc.,
176 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
thesoda-acid fireextinguisher (Fig. 17.10) isquite effective. The re-
action between thesodium bicarbonate andsulphuric acid solutions,
which mixwhen theextinguisher istipped, produces large quantities
ofcarbon dioxide. The resulting pressure notonly causes some ofthe
carbon dioxide todissolve inthesolution butalsoforces theliquid with
considerable force through thenozzle. Both thecoldwater andthe
smothering effect ofthecarbon dioxide, liberated from thereleased
liquid, areeffective inextinguishing the fire:
2NaHC03+H2S0 4Na2S0 4+2H20+2C0 2
Another fireextinguisher, efficient inextinguishing oilfires, contains
licorice inthebaking soda solution andconcentrated alum solution
inplace ofthesulphuric acid.Thealuminum hydroxide produced by
thereaction, together with the licorice, encloses thecarbon dioxide
inbubbles which form apersisting blanket offoam onthesurface of
the oil:
A12(S0 4)3+6NaHCOs >3Na 2S0 4+2Al(OH)3+6C0 2
Because itischeap andcanbeeasily liquefied, carbon dioxide is
employed toinflate rubber lifepreservers and rafts.Asmall metal
cylindrical tank, afewinches long, contains enough carbon dioxide
toinflate asmall raft.
When carbon dioxide is“dissolved inwater”, some ofthecarbon
dioxide reacts with thewater toform carbonic acid, aspreviously
stated, butmost ofthecarbon dioxide actually dissolves, itsmolecules
CARBON AND ITSCOMPOUNDS 177
being dispersed among themolecules ofwater. Forgases, similar to
carbon dioxide which donotcombine appreciably with water, ithas
beenfound thattheweights ofsuch gases, dissolving inagivenvolume
ofthesolvent, areproportional tothepressure. This isknown as
Henry’s Law.
Atatmospheric pressure and15°C.,onevolume ofwater dissolves
onevolume ofcarbon dioxide. Thus, ifthepressure isincreased to
10atmospheres, onevolume ofwater will dissolve approximately
10volumes ofcarbon dioxide. This istheprinciple utilized inthemanu-
facture ofsoft drinks. Carbon dioxide isdissolved insweetened,
flavoured water under considerable
pressure, bottled andcapped. When
thebottle isopened, thereduction
inpressure causes most ofthecar-
bondioxide tocome outofsolution.
Theescaping carbon dioxide bub-
bles,andthecarbonic acidremain-
ing,gives thebeverage apleasant,
tangy taste.
Mention hasbeenmade (p.174)
ofcarbon dioxide “snow” and its
usefulness inextinguishing fires.
Solid carbon dioxide ismade indus-
trially inlarge quantities and is
generally compressed into blocks
andsoldunder thename of“dry
ice”.Forpurposes ofrefrigeration,
thisproduct, asitsname implies, is
dry, i.e. itvaporizes without going
through theintermediate liquid state. Vaporization requires heat,and
theheattaken from thesurrounding substances hasacooling effect
onthem. Icecream trucks, restaurants, andcompanies dealing in
quickly frozen foods uselarge quantities of“dry ice”. This product
issometimes used insurgery todesensitize small areas ofskin.
Another important useofcarbon dioxide isintheleavening ofthe
dough inbread, biscuits, andcakes. Ascarbon dioxide isproduced
within thedough, thebubbles formed givethemass aporous texture.
Raking further increases thesizeoftheenclosed bubbles aswellas
theporosity ofthedough, andproduces thechemical reactions neces-
sary tochange thedough intoadigestible form. The greater area

bread, yeast plants areadded tothedough and, astheygrow, they
cause fermentation ofthesugar content thusproducing carbon dioxide
andalcohol. Baking drives offthealcohol intheform ofvapour. For
biscuits, sourmilkandbaking soda areused instead ofyeast. The
lactic acid inthesourmilk reacts with thesoda toliberate carbon
dioxide. Athird substance used inbaking isbaking powder. This isa
mixture ofbaking soda, anacid-acting ingredient (such ascream of
tartar, tartaric acid, orsodium
alum), andstarch. Starch helps

times thegasescapes from de-

gases from gasoline engines. Most manufactured gaseous fuels(Chap-
ter18)contain ahigh percentage ofcarbon monoxide.
Because carbon monoxide isintensely poisonous, itspreparation
andcollection must beattempted onlywithextreme care.
Preparation and collection. Themost convenient laboratory prepa-
ration isbytheaction ofconcentrated sulphuric acidonformic acid
(Fig. 17.12), oronsodium formate. Theroom should bewellventilated
(open windows), andprecautions taken toprevent theescape ofmore
than small amounts ofthegasintotheroom.

This reaction isanexample ofthedehydrating effect ofconcentrated
sulphuric acid initsremoval ofhydrogen andoxygen, inthesame
proportion asthey arefound inwater, from thedecomposing formic
acid.
Properties. Carbon monoxide isacolourless, odourless gasand is
only slightly soluble inwater. Itisintensely poisonous and, ifbreathed
continuously, one part in1,500
parts ofairwillprove fatal. Its
poisonous nature comes from its
ability tocombine with thehaemo-
globin oftheblood toform abright-
redstable compound called car-
boxy-haemoglobin. Because the
blood isnolonger able toform
oxyhaemoglobin, theoxygen-carry-
ingpigment, thevictim suffocates
because ofthelack ofoxygen in
hissystem. Symptoms ofcarbon
monoxide poisoning arebright-pink

OTHER COMPOUNDS OFCARBON
Carbon forms thousands ofcompounds with hydrogen. Anycom-
pound consisting ofthetwoelements, carbon andhydrogen, iscalled
ahydrocarbon. One ofthese hydrocarbons isacetylene (C2H2).
Acetylene. Preparation. Acetylene isusually prepared inthelabora-
tory (inanimpure form) bytheaction ofwater oncalcium carbide

Properties. Pure acetylene isacolourless gaswitharather pleasant
odour. Itissoluble initsownvolume ofwater and isvery soluble in
alcohol andacetone. Itsdensity, compared with air, is26 :28-9. Itis
anunstable compound and,when compressed, islikely toexplode
with theevolution ofmuch heatwhen itdecomposes toformhydrogen
andcarbon. This renders thecompression ofthegas,and itsstorage
under pressure, somewhat dangerous. Acetylene burns inairwith a
smoky flame (incomplete combustion):
2C2H2+202—^C0 2+2H20+3C
When burned inburners ofspecial construction (supplying sufficient
CARBON AND ITSCOMPOUNDS 181
airforcomplete combustion) itgives avery brilliant flame. The
products ofcomplete combustion arecarbon dioxide andwater:
2CoH2+502>4C0 2+2H,0
Twovolumes ofacetylene would require 5volumes ofoxygen (approxi-
mately 25volumes ofair)atS.T.P. forcomplete combustion.
Amixture ofevenonepartofacety-
lene in20parts ofairisexplosive.
Uses.Themain useofacetylene is
intheoxy-acetylene torch, orblow-
pipe (Fig. 17.16) forcutting andwelding
metals. The acetylene isstored under
pressure insteel tanks containing felt
orasbestos pads soaked inacetone.
Acetone willdissolve many times its
ownvolume ofacetylene. When not
more than 100volumes aredissolved

energy liberated byafuel ismeasured inBritish Thermal Units

theconsumer, itwould seem reasonable topurchase fuelaccording to
itsability toliberate energy, butsincemany economic factors control
market prices, this isnotalways possible.
There arethree classes offuels: solid, liquid, andgaseous. Inthe

diminishing because ofitsbulkiness, itsrelatively lowheat content,
andthenecessity forforest conservation. Thedestructive distillation
ofwood (p.168)produces wood alcohol andmany other valuable
products.
Coal. Coal isbelieved tohavehad itsorigin inthevastaccumu-
lations oftheluxuriant plant growth oftheCarboniferous Period.
High temperatures andgreat pressures were factors which caused
these organic deposits tobetransformed into coal.Themostimportant
varieties ofcoalareanthracite (hard coal)andbituminous (soft coal).
Anthracite maycontain upto90% freecarbon. Itburns withaclean
blueflameandseldom gives offsmoke. Bituminous contains lesscarbon
buthasmuch more volatile material. Itshows layering, crumbles
easily, andburns with asmoky flame.When bituminous coal issub-

lent fuels, butthey arerather limited inusebecause thecost ofpro-
duction makes them tooexpensive.
Petroleum. Petroleum (crude oil) isthegreatest source ofliquid
fuels. Itisacomplex mixture ofcompounds containing carbon and
hydrogen (hydrocarbons), andhas
acharacteristic colour, odour, con-
sistency, andcomposition, depend-
ingontheregion fromwhich itis
obtained. Although thehydrocar-
bons inpetroleum areprincipally
liquids, many solid andgaseous
hydrocarbons exist assolutes in
solution. Petroleum canbeused as
afuelinitsnatural state. However,
through heating thepetroleum and
separately condensing thevapours
ofthevarious hydrocarbons, many
purer products ofgreater value
canbeobtained. The process of
refining petroleum inthisway is
known asfractional distillation,
and theresulting products which
volatilize between certain temper-
ature limitsmay beclassified into
thefollowing groups: naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, fuel oil, light
lubricating oil,heavy lubricating oil,vaseline, paraffin, andpetroleum
coke.
Fractional distillation iscarried out inafractionating column, or
“bubble tower”. Thecrude oilisheated inalarge stillconnected to
thefractionating column. The gases escape atthetop; thelightest
fractions (lowest boiling points) enter special tubes nearthetopofthe
tower andcondense, andtheheavier fractions (higher boiling points)
condense, each atitsownparticular level. Gasoline isthemost impor-
tant fraction. Because oftheincreasing demand forgasoline, chemistsImperial Oil

carbon molecules into lighter “gasoline” molecules. Along with the
necessity formore gasoline came theneed forbetter gasoline. Much
research hasgone intotheproduction ofanti-knock compounds, anti-
oxidants, andhigh “octane ratings”. With automobile companies
manufacturing more efficient internal combustion engines with in-
creased cylinder compression ratios anddecreased engine weight, the
refineries have been forced toprovide more efficient fuels.
Initsvarious grades, fuel oiloccupies animportant place inmodern
living. Diesel engines operate onthisrelatively cheap fuelasdooil-
burners used fordomestic heating. Kerosene, formerly used ex-
tensively inoillamps, isnowbeing largely converted into gasoline.

Natural gas.Theterm “natural” distinguishes thegases found
trapped inpockets oftheearth from “artificial” gases. Natural gas,
being amixture, hasavariable composition. Itsmaincomponent is
either methane (CH 4)orethane (C2H6).Itwas firstdiscovered in
Ontario in1891andpiped toDetroit andBuffalo forindustrial use.
Themost important source, todate, inCanada istheViking-Kinsella
Field inAlberta. Natural gas isgenerally associated with petroleum
onwhich itcreates apressure sufficient toforce thepetroleum tothe
surface. Most Canadian natural gases contain asmall percentage of
helium. Carbon black results when natural gases burn inalimited

Where natural gas isnotavailable, artificial gases aremanufactured
forindustrial anddomestic purposes.

methane andhydrogen andpossibly some carbon monoxide. Impuri-

FLAMES
Ithasbeen previously stated that theenergy released byafuel is
theresult ofcombustion, andappears intheform oflight orheat.
Burning witha“flame” differs fromburning with a“glow” inthata
flame always indicates achemical reaction between gases, whereas a
glow indicates oxidation without theformation ofagaseous state.
192 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Burning solids donotemitaflame unless volatile matter isexpelled,
hence ironburns inoxygen without aflame, andunless carbon mon-
oxide isformed, carbon burns without aflame.
Theluminosity ofaflame isgenerally caused bythepresence of
glowing solid matter such asincandescent carbon orquicklime.
Acetylene, forexample, isahydrocarbon thatdecomposes when heated:
C2H2^2CH-H2
Theluminosity isproduced bythefreecarbon. Complete andincom-
pletecombustion ofacetylene arediscussed inChapter 17.
Inorder toobtain themost heatfrom afuel itisnecessary toinsure
itscomplete combustion. The equation, C-f02>C0 2+94,390
cal.,represents thecomplete combustion of12gm.ofcarbon, whereas
theequation 2C+02>2COT26,430 cal.shows theincom-
plete combustion ofthesame weight ofcarbon. Itisquite evident
that theincomplete combustion ofafuel
results inadrastic reduction intheheat
value.

byaspecial valve orcollar near thebase

that itwasaprinciple offireandexisted inallcombustible bodies.
The foulodour ofsome ofthecompounds ofsulphur, orbrimstone
asthealchemists knew it,ledLeoAfricanus (about 1500 a.d.) to
write that“chemists areamost stupid setofmenwhocontaminate
themselves with sulphur and other horrible stinks”. Chaucer, a
century earlier, hadmuch thesame idea.
SULPHUR
Occurrence. Sulphur resembles
oxygen inthat itoccurs innature
both inthefreestate and incom-
bination with other elements. In
itscombined state, sulphur isusu-
allyassociated with metals, andthe
minerals are valued more for
their metal than fortheir sulphur
content. Most ofthese minerals are
either sulphides orsulphates. The
sulphides include pyrites (FeS 2),
chalcopyrites (CuFeS 2),cinnabar
(HgS), galena (PbS), and sphal-
erite orzinc blende (ZnS). Sul-
phides ofsilver, tin, nickel, ar-
senic, andantimony alsooccur in
nature. The sulphates include
gypsum (CaS0 4.2H20),Epsom

VA“AIRLINEsalt(MgS0 4.7H20),and barytes (BaS0 4).
Sulphur isalsopresent inmany animal andplant substances such
aseggs, onions, andmeat.
Extraction. Most ofthesulphur
used inindustry ismined from
native sulphur. Prior to1903,much
ofthiscame from Sicily where it
isfound freebutmixed with vol-
canic rocks.Therockmass isheated
byburning sulphur. Intheprocess,
theunburned sulphur melts and
isrun offand purified bydistill-
ation. Ifthevapours aresuddenly
cooled, flowers ofsulphur sublime;
ifthevapours cool slowly, liquid
sulphur isformed and isruninto
molds togive rollsulphur. Sulphur,
found inthedormant volcano
Popocatepetl inMexico, istreated
inmuch thesame manner asin
Sicily.
More than three-fourths ofthe
world’s supply ofsulphur isnow
produced intheUnited States. In
1867, while drilling for oil in
Louisiana, geologists found asul-
phur deposit atadepth ofabout
500 feetburied beneath layers of
bog,quicksand, androck. Because
ofthequicksand andthepoisonous
hydrogen sulphide fumes permeat-
ing it,efforts tosink ashaft to
mine thesulphur ended indisaster.
Byconnecting thetwo facts
that themelting point ofsulphur
is112-8°C. and that theboiling
point ofwater canberaised byin-
creasing the pressure, ayoung
chemist, Herman Frasch, perfected
themodern sulphur mining method.
Thismethod isnowused extensively inTexas andLouisiana where
there aremany deposits similar tothose oftheoriginal discovery.Freeport Sulphur Company

Atypical sulphur deposit issomewhat egg-shaped, about halfamile
indiameter andalmost 500feetthick.
IntheFrasch process, awell isdrilled anda10-inch pipedriven to
thetopofthesulphur deposit. This pipe serves asacasing forthree
concentric pipes within, an8-inch “hotwater pipe”, a3-inch “sulphur
pipe”, andal|-inch “compressed airpipe”. The8-inch pipe isperfo-
rated atthelower endand ex-
tends tothebottom ofthesulphur
deposit. Water, superheated toa
temperature ofabout 170°C.and
under apressure ofabout 120
pounds tothesquare inch, isforced
down thispipeandhotcompressed
air isforced down thelf-inch pipe.
Thecombined water and airpres-
sures force themelted “air-filled”
sulphur, intheform offrothy foam,
upthe3-inch pipe.Themolten
sulphur isdirected towards storage
bins, oneofwhich willholdmany
thousands oftons, and allowed
tosolidify intomountainous-sized
blocks. From thesolid mass, sul-
phur isblasted andscooped intorailway cars. Sulphur obtained by
theFrasch process ismore than99-5% pure and several million
tons areproduced annually. When Frasch firstsuggested “pumping
asolid out oftheearth”, there wasascoffer who offered to“eat
every ounce ofsulphur pumped”. What atimehewould have had
making good hisoffer!
Therecent discovery ofasulphur bedinnorth central Alberta may
result inCanada’s firstFrasch-process plant forsulphur production.
Physical properties. Sulphur exists inthree different forms, rhombic,
prismatic, andamorphous. These allotropic modifications have dif-
ferent shapes, colours, densities, and solubilities, buttheir chemical
behaviour isthesame.Rhombic sulphur isthestable form atordinary
temperatures andcomprises almost allthesulphur used incommerce.
Itisapale-yellow, brittle, crystalline, odourless, tasteless solid.The
crystals arerhombic, oroctahedral, inshape. Rhombic sulphur is
insoluble inwater butreadily soluble incarbon disulphide. Ithasa
specific gravity of2-06andmelts at112-8° C.Large crystals ofthis
formmaybeprepared bydissolving rollsulphur incarbon disulphide
andallowing thesolvent toevaporate slowly.Freeport Sulphur Company

Prismatic, ormonoclinic, sulphur isstable onlybetween 96°C.and
119°C.It,too, iscrystalline, butthecrystals areneedle-shaped and
transparent andhave aspecific gravity of1-96. Itisinsoluble inboth

pound. Large quantities ofsulphur arealso used invulcanizing
rubber, during which process rubber ismade tough, hard,anddurable.
Vulcanization, discovered accidentally in1839byCharles Goodyear,
consists ofheating melted sulphur andrubber.
Additional uses ofsulphur occur inthemanufacture ofcalcium

HYDROGEN SULPHIDE (H2S)
Occurrence. Hydrogen sulphide
isfound innature wherever putre-
faction ofanimal orvegetable mat-
teroccurs. Itisalsofound among
vapours issuing from volcanoes, and
insome natural gases. Solutions of
hydrogen sulphide occur asnatural
waters called “sulphur springs”.
Preparation. Theconvenient lab-
oratory method ofpreparation is
bytheaction ofdilute hydro-
chloric acidonametallic sulphide.
Thesulphide mostcommonly used
isferrous sulphide.
FeS+2HC1—>FeCl 2+H2S
Thegas iscollected bytheupward displacement ofair(Fig. 19.7).
Properties. Physical. Hydrogen sulphide isacolourless gaswith
anoffensive odour likethat ofrotten eggs.The putrefaction ofany
organic matter containing sulphur results inthissame offensive
odour. Itisslightly denser than air(34:28-9), fairly soluble inwater,
andcanbeeasily liquefied. Itisaverypoisonous gas,butfortunately

Asolution ofhydrogen sulphide isaveryweak acidand isknown as
hydrosulphuric acid. Salts ofthisacid arecalled sulphides.
Apiece ofpaper thathasbeen dipped into lead acetate solution
turnsbrown andthenblackwhen exposed tohydrogen sulphide. This

Uses.Theonlyimportant useofhydrogen sulphide isinchemical
analyses. Because oftheinstability ofhydrosulphuric acid, aKipp
generator isusually used inthelaboratory forthepreparation ofthe
gasasneeded.
Most ofthemetallic sulphides areinsoluble inwater andsome of
them areinsoluble inacids. Inaddition, sulphides show avariety of
quite distinctive colours. Because ofthese characteristics, achemist
canusehydrogen sulphide todetect thepresence ofmetal ions in
solution. Forexample, ifhydrogen sulphide isbubbled intoadilute
acid solution containing cupric chloride, ablack precipitate ofcupric
sulphide results.

SULPHUR DIOXIDE (S02)
Occurrence. Sulphur dioxide isfound ingases issuing from volcanoes.
Traces arealsofound intheairofindustrial towns where coal, con-
taining sulphides, isburned.
Preparation. Industrially, large quantities ofsulphur dioxide are
prepared byburning sulphur inairorbyroasting ametallic sulphide,
generally pyrites (FeS2).Roasting consists ofheating incontact with
air.

(95calories), sulphur dioxide issometimes used asarefrigerant.
2.Inbleaching. Sulphur dioxide reacts withsome coloured sub-
stances toform colourless compounds. The bleaching isbrought
about byareducing action inwhich thesulphur dioxide robs the
colouring matter ofpart ofitsoxygen toproduce acolourless com-
pound. The reactions with organic dyes arequite complex, butcould

Sulphur dioxide isused tobleach wool, silk,andstraw, toallofwhich
chlorine would beinjurious. Substances bleached bysulphur dioxide
often return totheir original colour because ofreoxidation.

used toimprove thetaste ofwater supplied tolarge cities, e.g.Toronto.
Inaddition tokilling bacteria, chlorine inexcessive doses (super-
chlorination) will partially remove from water any objectionable
taste caused byrefuse from industrial plants, but itdoes leave the
water with astrong chlorinous flavour. Sulphur dioxide isthen used

SULPHURIC ACID (H
2S04)
Preparation. Sulphur trioxide istheanhydride ofsulphuric acid.
Therefore theproblem offinding acommercial method ofpreparing
thisacid resolves itself intotheproblem ofmaking sulphur trioxide in
quantity. Thiswassolved with thediscovery ofasuitable catalyst
thathastened theoxidation ofsulphur dioxide.
Contact process. The catalyst firstusedwasplatinum, prepared by
heating asbestos fibres, previously soaked inchloroplatinic acid,and
heating theasbestos until theaciddecomposed toform finely divided
platinum onthefibres. Thesulphur dioxide canbeformed byburning
(roasting) iron pyrites (FeS 2)orbyburning pure sulphur. Arsenic
impurities usually present inthepyrites “poison” theplatinum so
that itloses itscatalytic properties. Today, inthemostmodern plants,
vanadium pentoxide, deposited onapreparation ofsilica, isbeing
increasingly used. Itisunaffected byarsenic impurities and isjustas
efficient acatalyst asplatinum.
Sulphur dioxide and air,atatemperature ofabout 400° C.,are
passed over thecatalyst andsulphur trioxide results.

Chamber process. Thismethod usesnitrogen dioxide asthecatalyst,
andthereaction occurs inthepresence ofsteam oraspray ofwater in
large leadchambers. Thereaction takes place slowly andtherefore the
gases areallowed prolonged contact (about three hours) withonean-
other intheleadchambers. Thenitrogen dioxide isrecovered foruse
again. Theacidproduced isknown aschamber acidand isnever more
than70% sulphuric acid,but itcanbefurther treated toconcentrate
andpurify it.Chamber acid isused inprocesses notrequiring apure
product, e.g.themanufacture ofwashing soda,ammonium sulphate,
superphosphate oflime, etc.Thecontact acid isused inthepreparation
ofcertain food stuffs, dyes, drugs, andbatteries.
Properties. Physical. Pure sulphuric acid isanoilyliquid which can
befrozen toformwhite crystals. Pure acid isseldom made, and itcan
beprepared onlywith difficulty. Dilute acidcanbeconcentrated only
to98-3% byboiling. Thisconcentrated acid,commonly called “oilof
vitriol”, isalso oily inappearance, hasaspecific gravity of1-84,and
boils atavery hightemperature of338° C.Itiscolourless, butcom-
mercial acidmay bebrown orblack depending onthepresence of
organic impurities. Thepure acid isanon-electrolyte, but itconducts
electricity readily when itisdiluted.
Chemical. Concentrated sulphuric acidhasagreat affinity forwater.
When theacid isadded towater, agreat deal ofheat isevolved;thus
theacidshould beadded inathinstream with constant stirring so
thatthelargevolume ofwatermayabsorb theheatdeveloped. Water
should never bepoured into theconcentrated acidbecause “local” heating
willcause boiling and scatter theacid.The action with water is
chemical andexothermic andforms aliquid hydrate ofsulphuric acid
(H 2S0 4.H20).
Theattraction ofconcentrated sulphuric acid forwater issogreat
that itwilldecompose alarge number ofsubstances containing
hydrogen andoxygen inthesame proportion asthey arefound in
water eliminating these elements from thecompound aswater, with
which theacidcombines (dehydrating action). Thus cane sugar
(C12H22O11),starch, cotton, andwool, allofwhich contain carbon,
oxygen, andhydrogen become carbonized when concentrated sulphuric
acid isadded. Atthesame time, hydrogen andoxygen areremoved
aswater, leaving ablack porous mass ofcarbon:

Hotconcentrated sulphuric acid acts asanoxidizing agent, and
during oxidation isitself reduced bymany substances toeither sulphur
SULPHUR AND ITSCOMPOUNDS 207
dioxide orsulphur. Ifcharcoal isboiled intheacid, thecarbon is
oxidized tocarbon dioxide:
2H0SO4TC y2SO2 -f-2HoO -j-C02
Theaction ofsulphuric acidonmetals depends upon theconcen-
tration andtemperature oftheacidaswellasonthenature ofthemetal
involved. Thus dilute acidreacts withmost metals with theformation
ofsulphates andhydrogen. However, itdoes not affect mercury,
copper, gold, silver, orplatinum. Aluminum reacts slowly with dilute
acidbut iftheacid iswarmed theaction isvigorous, andhydrogen
andaluminum sulphate areformed. Cold concentrated acid has
practically noeffect onthemetals (except sodium, potassium, and
magnesium). Thehotconcentrated acid,however, actsonmost metals
toform sulphur dioxide, water, andasulphate:
Cu+2H0SO4 >CuS0 4+2HoO+S0 2
Inaddition totheabove specialized properties, sulphuric acidshows
alltheproperties ofatypical strong acid.
Uses. Sulphuric acid isprobably themost important chemical com-
pound known. Itisused inpractically every industry. Regarding its
use,thestatement isoftenmade that“the civilization ofacountry is
measured bytheamount ofsulphuric acid ituses”.
Because ofitsdehydrating action, sulphuric acid isused tocharand
remove certain organic impurities inrefining petroleum. Itisimportant
also inthepreparation ofmost explosives toremove thewater formed
bythereaction, e.g.
C3H5(OH)3+3HN03>C3H5(N03)3+3H20
Glycerine Nitroglycerine
Ifsulphuric acidwerenotused, theaction could notcontinue because
ofthedilution caused bythewater formed. Itsdehydrating action is
alsoemployed inmaking photographic films. Inthelaboratory itis
often used fordrying gases.
Because ofitshigh boiling point, sulphuric acid enters into the
preparation ofhydrochloric, nitric, andother lessimportant acids.
Inthesteel industry, theacid isvaluable forremoving rust(pickling)
before themetal receives acoating ofenamel, zinc, ortin.Large
quantities areused intanning leather, converting starch intoglucose,
and inthemanufacture ofrayon fromwood pulp.Theacid isalsoused
inmaking storage batteries.
Many thousands oftons ofsulphuric acidgoannually into the
preparation offertilizers, chief ofwhich aresuperphosphate oflime
andammonium sulphate.
208 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Sulphates. Many sulphates occur asnatural deposits; chief ofthese
isgypsum, important inthebuilding trade andinthemanufacture of
plaster ofParis. Another natural deposit isthemineral barytes, the
sulphate ofbarium, used inmaking paints andinweighting paper and
rubber. Stillanother isEpsom salt, ahydrated magnesium sulphate,
used asacathartic. Sulphates manufactured byusing sulphuric acid
include Glauber’s salt,animportant medicine; alum, astyptic; alumi-
num sulphate, amordant andawater clarifier; bluestone, avaluable
ingredient incopper plating, fungicides, andapreservative ofwoodand
hides; andgreen vitriol, ahydrated ferrous sulphate used ininkand
dyemanufacture and intanning leather.
Soluble sulphates canbedetected bydissolving inwater andadding
abarium chloride solution. However, because both sulphates and
sulphites give white precipitates ofbarium sulphate andbarium
sulphite respectively, aconfirmatory test isnecessary. Ontheaddition
ofdilute hydrochloric acid,barium sulphite dissolves, butthebarium
sulphate precipitate, being insoluble indilute hydrochloric acid, re-
mains. Theabove tests areused toidentify sulphates andsulphites.

Saltand ItsPlace inIndustry
Canthatwhich isunsavoury beeaten without salt?
JobVI: 6.
Salt, ofsodium chloride (NaCl), isoneofthefewvitally essential
minerals taken from theearth. Probably thedetails ofMan’s discovery
ofsalt willalways beamatter ofconjecture. Saltmayhave been
firstdiscovered asanoutcropping ofawhite crystalline rock, orone
ofourfar-removed ancestors, having eaten some sea-weed castupon
theshore,may have, enjoyed itssalty flavour. Later, perhaps, asalt
supply wasderived from crude deposits remaining after pools ofsea-
water hadevaporated under theintense heat ofthesun.
COMMON SALT (NaCl)
Occurrence. The effect ofsaltonthetaste offood increased the
demand for it,andhistorians inform usthatmany great centres of
civilization .came into being be-
cause ofbarter with salt. Salt
occurs insolution intheocean, in
salt lakes, insalt wells, andasa
solid inrock-salt deposits. Nature
has liberally distributed salt
throughout Canada, particularly
inOntario. Insouthwestern Ont-
ario, intheregion oftheDetroit
River, thedeposits ofrock-salt are
sovastthatexperts estimate them
sufficient toserve theworld for
90,000 years. These huge deposits
indicate that atsome time inthe
past thisareawascovered with
sea-water. These saltbeds, covering
anarea ofatleast 3,000 sq.mi.,
areabout onethousand feetbelow
thesurface oftheearthandvary in
thickness from 100feetto230 feet.
Commercial recovery. The salt ofsubterranean deposits may be
obtained either bydigging tothedeposit andmining itdirectly, or

ofthe saltbedand dissolving
thesaltwith water. The latter
method isthecommon one in
mostmodern saltplants. Water,
forced under apressure of175
pounds persquare inchdown a
large outer pipe, dissolves the
salt,andthepressure forces the
resulting brine upasmaller,
inner pipe (Fig. 20.2). Huge set-
tling tanks, holding thousands
ofgallons each, receive thebrine,
and, after theinsoluble materials
settle, the clear salt solution
flows toaseries ofvacuum eva-
porators (Fig. 20.3) forcrystal-
lization.
Live steam isadmitted into
thesteam chamber ofthe first
panwhere thebrine starts to
boil.Thesteam from itpasses
tothesteam chamber ofthe
second pan ofcomparatively
cool brine where itcondenses
andgivesupitsheat tothebrine.
Thiscondensation ofsteam cre-
atesapartial vacuum extending
tothe firstpan.Soon thebrine
inthesecond panstarts toboil,
andtheresultant steam passes
ontothesteam chamber ofthe
thirdpanwhere itcondenses and
heats thebrine inthispan.This
creates apartial vacuum inthe
second pan.Astream ofcold
water, falling through theva-
cuumpump attached tothethird
pan,condenses thesteam drawn
offbythepump, thus creating
andsustaining ahigh degree of
vacuum inthethird pan.The

brine soon starts toboilwithout getting more than fairly warm.
Inapartial vacuum, water boils atareduced temperature; thusby
reducing thepressure successively from oneevaporator tothenext,
theoriginal heat isused three, oreven fourtimes asinFig. 20.3.
Themoist crystallized salt isremoved automatically toaspecial
fine-screen filterwhere continuous suction removes most ofthewater.
Itisthen transferred tolarge revolving cylinders through which air,
heated wellabove theboiling point ofwater, isforced until thesalt
isperfectly dryandready forscreening according tothesizeofthe
crystals.
The finest crystals areused fortable salt,andthelarger onesgo
into theproduction ofdairy salt, ortheymay becompressed into
blocks for“cattle licks” orintosmall tablets forhuman consumption.
Millions ofthese tablets areused annually inCanadian factories to
prevent heatcramps andheat prostration. Larger tablets areimpor-
tant inthecanning industry where uniformity offlavour issecured
when onetablet isdeposited inevery canbyautomatic dispensing

Although each crystal istransparent, amass ofcrystals appears white.
Salt isalmost assoluble incoldwater asitisinhot (seeSolubility
214 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Curve, p.77). Itmelts attherather hightemperature of805° C.,
andinthisfused condition conducts acurrent ofelectricity, thus indi-
cating theexistence offreesodium ionsandchloride ions(Chapter 16).
Electrolysis ofsaltsolution. When sodium chloride isdissolved in
water, itdissociates into positively charged sodium ions(Na+
),and
negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-
).
NaCl >Na++Cl-
When anelectric current ispassed through thissolution, thechloride
ions (anions) areattracted tothepositively charged anode where each
givesupitsextra electron andbecomes aneutral atom ofchlorine.
Cl--e—>

Thechlorine atoms immediately combine inpairs toform chlorine

Thesodium ions (cations) areattracted tothenegatively charged
cathode where each ionreceives anelectron andbecomes asodium
atom.
Na++€>Na°
Theatoms ofsodium, thusformed, have alltheproperties ofsodium
“metal”, andunlike sodium ionstheycannot exist inthepresence of
water. Thesodium atoms immediately react with thewater toform
sodium hydroxide andhydrogen. The latter rises asbubbles from the
cathode.
2Na+2H20>2NaOH+H2
Hence theelectrolysis ofasaltsolution results inchlorine gas
forming attheanode, while hydrogen gasandsodium hydroxide
solution gather atthecathode. Both ofthese gases canbecollected,
and astheaction continues thesolution becomes more andmore
concentrated withsodium hydroxide.
When thesolution ofsodium hydroxide isevaporated todryness, a
white deposit ofsolidsodium hydroxide, commonly known ascaustic
soda, remains.
Intheelectrolysis ofasolution ofsodium chloride, chlorine isa
primary product because itforms directly from ions losing their elec-
trical charges. Hydrogen andsodium hydroxide aresecondary pro-
ducts because they areformed byasecondary reaction.
There isanother, andpossibly more exact, explanation ofelectro-
lysis ofbrine involving theionization ofwater. Water provides avery
small quantity ofH+ionsandOH-(hydroxyl) ions.Asaltsolution
SALTAND ITSPLACE ININDUSTRY 215
contains Na+

,H+

Na+andH+areattracted tothecathode, andthenegatively charged
Cl-andOH-ions totheanode. Ofthepositive ions,H+ionsaccept
electrons more readily thandotheNa+ions, soonlyH+ions are
neutralized. TheNa+isunaffected. Similarly, Cl-
isneutralized at
theanode andtheOH-remains unaffected. Thus hydrogen isliberated
atthecathode andchlorine attheanode. TheNa+andOH-ionsunite
toformNaOH insolution.
Caustic soda isdeliquescent, dissolves readily inwater liberating
considerable heat,andproduces analkaline solution. Ithasmany uses
inindustry.
Theuses ofhydrogen havebeen given inChapter 6andtheproper-
tiesanduses ofchlorine willbefound inthefollowing chapter. The
hydrogen andchlorine aresometimes combined toproduce hydrogen

Sodium bicarbonate, orbaking soda, andsodium carbonate, orsal
soda, aremade directly fromsodium chloride byacontinuous indus-
trial process, theSolvay process, requiring rather elaborate apparatus.
Asaturated water solution ofsalt, isfurther saturated with both
ammonia gasandcarbon dioxide gasinspecially constructed towers.
Thecarbon dioxide, under pressure, dissolves forming carbonic acid,
andtheammonia readily dissolves forming ammonium hydroxide.
The acidandthebase react toproduce asolution ofammonium bi-
carbonate inwater. Theammonium bicarbonate reacts with thesalt
solution toform sodium bicarbonate andammonium chloride. The
sodium bicarbonate, being insoluble intheconcentrated saltsolution,
precipitates out,and isheated toconvert itintosodium carbonate.

with sulphites toproduce sulphur dioxide.

ammonium chloride result.

USESOFCOMMON SALT
Theprime household uses ofsaltareforseasoning andpreserving
food. Itisalsoserviceable inice-cream freezers, intheremoval ofice
from sidewalks, andasadentifrice.
Salt isabsolutely essential inalldiets.Many farmers preserve fresh
meatbysalting it,andtheuseofsmoked saltenhances theflavour.
Salt, used instorage ofhaycrops, accomplishes three things, viz. it
adds tothehay’s palatability;itpromotes better curing; and itreduces
thedanger ofheating andspontaneous combustion.
Industry hasmany uses forsalt.Food industries useconsiderable
quantities ofitforcuring, pickling, preserving andseasoning. Large
amounts ofsalthave their place inthedyeing andfinishing oftextiles.
Zeolite water-softeners require salt toregenerate the zeolite. Raw
skins areprepared with salt forthetanning process. Inthemanu-
facture ofartificial ice,saltbrine isthecommon cooling medium. Salt
and iceareused toobtain andmaintain thelowtemperatures required
insome refrigerator cars forthetransportation ofperishable food
products.
Salt isthesource fromwhich mostsodium compounds arederived.
Among these aresodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium
carbonate, sodium sulphate, andsodium hypochlorite. Salt isalsoused
intheproduction ofchlorine, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen, synthetic
ammonia, nitric acid, soap, glass, ceramics, andpaper and itisequally
indispensable intherefining ofpetroleum.

TheHalogens
But dephlogistocated marine acid (chlorine), which destroys all
vegetable colours more orless easily, acts inadifferent manner on
animal colours.
M.Berthollet
Fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, andastatine produce substances
resembling common saltincomposition andchemical action, andhence
areknown ashalogens, aname meaning formers ofsea salt,andthe
metallic compounds ofhalogens arecalled halides. Thehalogens are
univalent andhave themostpronounced non-metallic characteristics
ofanyrelated group ofelements.
FLUORINE
Fluorine, themost active halogen, hasbeen called “the devil ele-
ment” because ofitsunruly nature. Only recently has itbeenharnessed
fortheservice ofmankind.
Fluorine isapalegreenish-yellow gas, slightly denser than airand
quite poisonous. Henri Moissan isolated itin1886, butalmost sixty
years passed before scientists solved theproblems ofproducing itin
large quantities andhandling itsafely.
Asanelement, ithasfew uses, butcompounds offluorine are
becoming more important. Hydrofluoric acid isoneofthemost cor-
rosive compounds known, andalthough used foretching glass is
employed more extensively inthemanufacture ofaseries ofcomplex
organic compounds called freons. Themost widely usedmember of
this series isanon-corrosive, non-toxic, non-inflammable, andalmost
colourless gas. Itcanbereadily liquefied under moderate pressure
andused asarefrigerant. “Aerosol” insecticide isasolution ofpyre-
thrum infreon. Fluorine compounds arealsoofuseinthemanufacture
ofrodenticides andafew plastics. Fluorides areproving effective in
anti-caries.
CHLORINE
Chlorine was firstprepared byaSwedish chemist KarlWilhelm
Scheele in1774frommanganese dioxide andhydrochloric acid, but

itwasnotrecognized asanelement until 1810when SirHumphry
Davy named itchlorine(chloros,green).
Occurrence. Chlorine, thesecond most active non-metallic element,
isnever found intheuncombined, orfree, state. Itmostcommonly
occurs asachloride incombi-

Laboratory preparation. The
most satisfactory laboratory
method ofproducing chlorine
isbytheoxidation ofhydro-
chloric acid. Ifmanganese di-
oxide isused astheoxidizing
agent, itisnecessary towarm
thegenerator gently (Fig. 21.2).

Itisalsopossible toliberate chlorine fromsodium chloride bygently
heating amixture ofthesaltwithmanganese dioxide andconcentrated
sulphuric acid.However, thechlorine soproduced isnotentirely free
fromhydrogen chloride.
Commercial preparation. Chlorine isoneoftheproducts resulting
from theelectrolysis ofasolution ofsodium chloride (Chapter 20).
Physical properties. Chlorine isapoisonous gasofgreenish-yellow
colour andvery irritating odour. Itisdenser than air(71:28-9), and
liquefies atroom temperature (20°C.) ifsubjected toapressure of
6-6atmospheres. Atatmospheric pressure, chlorine turns toaliquid
at—34-6° C.and freezes at—102°C.Itismoderately soluble in
water, 1-47gm.dissolving in100gm.water at0°C.
Chemical properties. Ofthenon-metals, chlorine issecond only to
fluorine inchemical activity. This great activity isattributed tothe
eagerness withwhich thechlorine atom gains anelectron tocomplete
itsthird (valence) ring.

6.Water. The bleaching action ofchlorine inthepresence of
moisture isfurther proof ofitsaffinity forhydrogen. When chlorine
reacts with water, aseries ofchemical actions take place toform
atomic oxygen. Theprobable reactions taking place arerepresented
thus:
H20+Cl2 HC1+HCIO
HCIO—->HC1+[O]
H20+Cl2>2HC1+[O]atomic
The unstable hypochlorous acid
decomposes, with the liberation
oftheactive atomic oxygen, which
inturn isresponsible forboth
bleaching action and germicidal
action. Chlorine isknown asan
oxidizing agent because itmakes
atomic oxygen available foroxi-
dizing colouring matter orbac-
teria. Bleaching with chlorine is
indirect contrast tobleaching
with sulphur dioxide because sul-
phur dioxide, inthebleaching
process, acts asareducing agent
byremoving oxygen.
Iffreshly prepared chlorine
water isallowed tostand, theatomic oxygen becomes molecular
andloses itsability tobleach; asolution ofhydrochloric acidremains.
2Cl2+2H20—*4HC1+02
Uses.Asableaching agent.Ahigh percentage ofthechlorine of
industry isused tobleach wood pulpandvegetable fibres. Chlorine,
however, permanently injures fibres ofanimal origin, e.g.wooland
silk.Even vegetable fibres cannot beexposed tochlorine fortoolong
atime. Precaution istaken toremove excess chlorine from thefibres
bywashing them first inasolution ofanantichlor, andthen inclear
water. Themostcommon antichlors aresodium sulphite, sodium
thiosulphate, andhydrogen peroxide.

The unstable sodium hypochlorite produces atomic oxygen that is
responsible forthebleaching qualities.
Chloroform (CHC13),andcarbon tetrachloride (CC1 4),inaddition to
many other compounds, owe their existence tochlorine.
Tests. Thechoking odour andthegreenish-yellow colour ofchlorine
arequite characteristic andmight beconsidered reliable tests, but
they arenot scientific. Thebestchemical testmakes useofthefact
that chlorine ismuch more active than iodine. When chlorine is
bubbled intoasolution ofpotassium iodide, theiodine isdisplaced,
andasthefreeiodine goes intosolution arichbrown colour occurs.

Fig. 21.7. Thelaboratory preparation andcollection ofbromine.
Occurrence. Bromine occurs inchemical combination withsodium,
potassium, andmagnesium. These salts arefound incertain mineral
springs, intheupper layers ofbeds ofrock salt,and insea-water.
Laboratory preparation. The usual method ofpreparing bromine
istorelease itfrom either sodium orpotassium bromide byadding
concentrated sulphuric acid toamixture ofthebromide andmanga-
nese dioxide andwarming gently. Ifthereaction iscarried outas
shown inFig. 21.7, aheavy brownish-red vapour fillsthegenerator
andgasbottle, anddrops ofliquid bromine condense inthecool
receiver.

Commercial preparation. Bromine isobtained from thebromides in
sea-water bydisplacement with chlorine. Theprocedure ismodified

dilute. The displaced bromine dissolves inthesolution andremains

Physical properties. Bromine, adeep brownish-red liquid, isthe
onlyelement except mercury that isliquid atordinary temperatures.
Itisquite volatile, producing abrownish-red, irritating, poisonous
vapour. Caution must beexercised tokeepbromine away from the
skinbecause itcauses severe burns. Liquid bromine hasadensity of
3-18gm.percc.at0°C.,aboiling point of58-7° C.,andamelting
point of—7-3° C.Itismore soluble inwater than chlorine, 4-17gm.
dissolving in100gm. ofwater at0°C.Bromine isquite soluble in
organic solvents such asalcohol, carbon disulphide, andcarbon tetra-
chloride, witheach ofwhich itforms acharacteristic reddish-orange
solution.
Chemical properties. Because thebromine atom islarger than the
chlorine atom, thetendency toattract anelectron toitsouter orbit
tocomplete thestable octet isnotsogreat asisthat ofthechlorine
atom. For thisreason, thechemical activity ofbromine islessthan
that ofchlorine. Bromine, however, isvery active, asshown byits
ability todisplace iodine from solutions ofiodides.
Br2T2KI ^2KBrTI2
Thebleaching properties ofbromine, although notsopronounced as
those ofchlorine, arenevertheless impressive. Hydrogen requires a
temperature of200°C.tounite with bromine producing hydrogen
bromide.
Both antimony andphosphorus burn spontaneously when placed
inbromine vapour toform bromides, andmost metals show theeffect
ofbeing attacked bythevapour.
Uses. Bromine isused chiefly inthemanufacture ofmany com-
pounds. During theFirstWorld War, itwasused inthemanufacture
of“tear gas”, and inrecent years inthepreparation ofethylene
dibromide (C2H4Br2),andthisinturn isused together with tetraethyl
lead inanti-knock gasoline. Bromine isalsoused extensively tomake
silver bromide forsensitizing photographic gelatines, and inthemanu-
facture ofsynthetic dyesandmedicinal preparations.
Test.With starch “solution”, bromine gives adistinctive reddish-
THEHALOGENS 229
orange colour. More active than iodine, bromine willdisplace itfrom
soluble iodides insolution.

This freeiodine willgiveacharacteristic deep-blue colour with starch

IODINE
In1811, aFrenchman, Bernard Courtois, noticed thatwhen the
containers used tomake saltpetre from theashes ofsea-weed, were
cleaned with sulphuric acid, abeautiful violet-coloured vapour was
produced. Courtois didnotknow thatthesea-weed contained iodides
from which anewandimportant element wassoon tobeisolated.
Hiscuriosity was sufficiently aroused, however, tocause him totell
thechemist, Gay-Lussac, about hisobservations. In1813, Gay-Lussac
wassuccessful inproducing theelement iodine, thename ofwhich was
derived from theGreek word meaning violet.

Fig. 21.8. Thelaboratory preparation andcollection ofiodine.
Occurrence. Although iodine islessactive than either chlorine and
bromine, itismuch tooactive tobefound free innature. Kelp, asea-
weed containing sodium iodide, served astheoriginal source ofall
iodine. The chief present-day sources ofiodine aretheiodides inbrine
230 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
wells ofCalifornia andLouisiana, andsodium iodate (NaI03),con-
tained intheChile saltpetre deposits.
Laboratory preparation. Inthelaboratory, iodine isprepared in
much thesameway asisbromine; sodium orpotassium iodide re-
places thecorresponding bromides.
2Nal+Mn0 2T2H2SO 4Na2S04MnSCX d~2H2O-f-I2
When these chemicals aregently heated, adense violet-coloured
vapour isproduced, and thisreadily sublimes onacold surface into
flat,shiny, steel-grey crystals.
Commercial preparation. There arefourcommon industrial methods
used inobtaining iodine.
1.Using kelp rather than themetallic halide inthemethod men-
tioned above.
2.Chlorine, added toasolution ofaniodide, displaces theslightly
soluble iodine whichmaybefiltered offanddried.
3.Silver nitrate, added toasolution ofaniodide, causes yellow
silver iodide tobeprecipitated. Both thesilver andtheiodine are
recovered bysubsequent treatment with ironandchlorine.
4.Sodium iodate, obtained from Chile saltpetre deposits, istreated
withsodium bisulphite solution and freeiodine isliberated.
Physical properties. The violet-coloured iodine vapour hasamost
irritating odour, andwhen cooled sublimes toform flatsteel-grey
crystals. Iodine melts at113-5° C.,andhasaspecific gravity of4-93.
Ifheated carefully, thesolidcanbeconverted directly tothevapour,
and thisvapour, onmeeting acold surface, reforms bysublimation
intothecrystalline state without atanytime entering theliquid state.
Iodine isalmost insoluble inwater, 0-019gm.dissolving in100gm.of
water at0°C.Itdissolves readily inmany organic solvents. Both
alcohol andether each produce abrown solution, whereas carbon
tetrachloride, carbon disulphide, andchloroform give violet-coloured
solutions.
Chemical properties. Because iodine istheleast active halogen,
both chlorine andbromine willdisplace itfrom iodides.

Uses. Iodine isused inthemanufacture ofdyes, drugs, andphoto-
graphic supplies. Tincture ofiodine, a2%to3%solution ofiodine
inamixture ofethyl alcohol andpotassium iodide, andiodoform
(CHI 3)arewidely used asantiseptics. Small quantities ofpotassium
iodide areadded tocommon saltasapreventative ofgoitre. Salttreated
inthismanner isknown as“iodized salt”.
Test. Free iodine incontact with starch “solution” produces an
intense blue colour. This colour provides atest foreither iodine, or
starch, and willdetect aslittle asonepart ofiodine infivemillion
parts ofsolution.
TESTS FORCHLORIDES, RROMIDES, andIODIDES
1.Aclear colourless solution known tobethat ofachloride, a
bromide, oraniodide, canreadily beidentified bybubbling chlorine
gasintothesolution. Ifitisachloride, theonly visible change willbe
that thesolution gradually acquires thegreenish-yellow colour of
chlorine. Ifitisabromide, thesolution willturnabrownish-red colour
because oftheliberation offreebromine which dissolves inthesolu-
tion.Thepresence ofbromine canbeconfirmed bytheaddition of
carbon tetrachloride, which gives areddish-orange colour. Ifaniodide,
thesolution turns adark-brown colour duetotheliberation offree
iodine which dissolves inthesolution. Thepresence ofiodine canbe
confirmed bytheaddition ofstarch “solution” which gives thechar-
acteristic blue colour, orbyadding either carbon tetrachloride or
carbon disulphide, which giveaviolet-coloured solution.
2.When silver nitrate solution isadded toasolution ofachloride,
acurdy white precipitate ofsilver chloride isformed:
NaCl+AgNOs >NaN03+AgCl
This precipitate darkens rapidly onexposure tosunlight andcom-
pletely dissolves ontheaddition ofammonium hydroxide. With a
bromide solution, silver nitrate produces acream-coloured precipitate,
and this alsodarkens onexposure tolight, butontheaddition of
ammonium hydroxide only partially dissolves'.
KBr+AgNOsKNOs+AgBr
With aniodide solution, silver nitrate produces apale-yellow precipi-
tatewhich alsodarkens onexposure tolight, but isinsoluble inam-
monium hydroxide:
Nal+AgN03>NaN03+Agl
Thecolour changes inthese tests areeasily distinguished when the
232 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
three areviewed together, buttheuseofammonium hydroxide is
essential asaconfirmatory test.
Chlorides, bromides, andiodides arenottheonly substances that
form precipitates with asilver nitrate solution. Achemical testmust
bespecific. Fortunately, silver chloride, silver bromide, and silver
iodide are allinsoluble indilute nitric acid, while other precipitates
thatmight bemistaken forthem (e.g. silver carbonate, silver phos-
phate) readily dissolve when dilute nitric acid isadded.

CHAPTER 22
Periodic Classification oftheElements
Iconsider itwell toobserve thatnolawofnature, however general,
hasbeen established allatonce; itsrecognition isalways preceded by
many hints; theestablishment ofalaw,however, doesnottake place
when itssignificance isrecognized, butonlywhen ithasbeenconfirmed
byexperiment, which theman ofscience must consider astheonlyproof
ofthecorrectness ofhisconjectures andopinions.
Mendeleeff
Relationships between atomic weights andchemical activity were
noted asearly as1817, but itwasnotuntil1864 thatJohnNewlands,
anEnglish chemist, published aseries ofpapers drawing attention to
thefactthat “Iftheelements arearranged intheorder ofthenew
(atomic) weights, derived byCannizzaro in1858, theeighth element,
starting from agiven one, isakind ofrepetition ofthe first—just
liketheeighth note inanoctave ofmusic.” Hesubmitted hisLaw of
Octaves totheChemical Society ofLondon in1866.TheChemical
Society, however, because oflack ofknowledge andunderstanding,
refused recognition. Newlands, discouraged bytheattitude and
ridicule ofsome ofhiscontemporaries, failed topursue further re-
search with theresult that credit forpresenting the firstacceptable
system ofclassification hasbeen given toDmitri Ivanovitch Men-
deReff, aRussian chemist (1834-1907).
Mendeleeff’s classification. Mendeleeff wasacareful thinker and
moremature thanNewlands, andhewasalsoachemist ofconsiderable
merit. Thefollowing paragraph from hiswritings expresses hismode
ofreasoning.
“Where itisimpossible tomake measurements, one isreluctantly
obliged tolimit oneself toapproximate comparisons founded on
apparent signs which arenotdistinct andarewanting inexactitude.
But intheelements there isoneaccurately measurable property which
issubject tonodoubt, namely theproperty which isexpressed in
theiratomic weights. Itsmagnitude indicates therelative mass ofthe
atom . ..therefore itismost natural toseek foradependence between
theproperties andanalogies oftheelements ontheonehandandtheir
atomic weights ontheother.”
234
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OFTHEELEMENTS 235
Suchwastheconcept that ledMendeleeff toarrange allofthethen
known elements inorder oftheir increasing atomic weights. Aperiodic
repetition ofproperties oftheelements became apparent andresulted
intheperiodic lawstating that
“If alltheelements arearranged
intheorder oftheir increasing
atomic weights,aperiodic repeti-
tion ofproperties isobtained.”In
1869, Mendeleeff presented to
theRussian Chemical Society a
paper entitled “OntheCorrelation
ofthe Properties andAtomic
Weights oftheElements.” His
original conclusions soclosely re-
semble those accepted today that
theywarrant mention here.
1.The elements, ifarranged
according totheiratomic weights,
exhibit anevident periodicity of
properties.
2.Elements, similar asregards
their chemical properties, have
atomic weights that areeither, ornearly, thesame value orthat
increase regularly.
3.Thearrangement oftheelements, orofgroups ofelements, in
theorder oftheir atomic weights corresponds with their valences.
4.Themagnitude oftheatomic weight determines thecharacter of
anelement.
5.Thediscovery ofmany yetunknown elements maybepredicted.
6.Theatomic weight ofanelement maysometimes becorrected
byaidofaknowledge oftheatomic weights oftheadjacent elements.
7.Certain characteristic properties oftheelements canbeforetold
from their atomic weights.
Iftheatomic weights oftheelements areexamined, something
amiss willbenoticed inconnection with three sets oftheelements.
Argon, withanatomic weight of39-9, precedes potassium withan
atomic weight of39T. Cobalt, atomic weight 58-94, precedes nickel,
atomic weight 58-69. Tellurium, atomic weight 127-6, precedes iodine,
atomic weight 126-92.
Moseley’s classification. Asaresult ofthebrilliant research accom-
plished byH.G.J.Moseley, ayoung British scientist who losthislife

deleeff (1834-1907), originator ofthe

236 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
asabasis forclassification hasbeen discarded infavour ofatomic
numbers. Theatomic number ofanelement corresponds tothenumber
ofprotons inthenucleus ofitsatom, orthenumber ofplanetary
electrons. When theelements arearranged intheorder oftheiratomic
numbers, without anyexception aperiodicity ofproperties results.
Hence, thePeriodic Law isnow stated asfollows: Thechemical
properties oftheelements areperiodic functions oftheiratomic numbers.
ATYPICAL FAMILY
The halogens, chlorine, bromine and iodine, offer anexcellent
illustration ofthearrangement ofelements intogroups having not
onlymarked similarities, butalsoagradation ofproperties asthe
atomic numbers increase.
Important similarities. 1.Atomic structure. Each halogen atom
lacks oneelectron initsouter orbit. Having seven valence electrons,
eachatom readily acquires oneelectron fromanysource inaneffort
tomake theouter orbit complete with eight electrons (stable octet).
2.Valence. Allexhibit anegative valence ofone.
3.Odour. Allpossess achoking irritating odour.
4.Bleaching action. Allexhibit bleaching properties, theaction
becoming definitely more feeble astheatomic number increases.
5.Preparation. Allmaybeprepared bythesame general method
from thesodium orpotassium halide:
2Na“X”+Mn02+2H 2S0 4>Na 2S0 4+MnS0 4+2H20-f“X 2”
6.Reaction with metals. Allreact chemically withmetals producing
corresponding chlorides, bromides, oriodides.
7.Reaction withhydrogen. Allform similar hydrides (HC1, HBr, HI).
8.Molecular formula. Allaresimilar inthatthemolecule isdiatomic
(Cl 2,Br2,I2).
Gradation ofproperties. 1.Physical state.Atordinary temperatures,
chlorine isagas,bromine aliquid, andiodine asolid.
2.Colour. Chlorine isgreenish-yellow, bromine reddish-brown, and
iodine steel-grey with adeep-violet vapour.
3.Atomic number. Chlorine 17,bromine 35,iodine 53.
4.Atomic weight. Chlorine 35-5,bromine 80,iodine 127.
5.Activity. Chemical activity decreases with increased atomic
number. This isparticularly truewith respect totheactivity with
non-metals. The relative activities arealso illustrated intheexperi-
ments designed toshow that chlorine displaces bromine andiodine
from bromides and iodides, respectively, andthatbromine displaces
iodine from iodides.
PERIODIC CLASSIFICATION OFTHEELEMENTS 237
THEPERIODIC CLASSIFICATION
General observations. 1.Thevalence oftheelement corresponds
tothenumber ofthegroup inwhich theelement occurs. (The inert
gases have avalence ofzero (0)since these elements donotform
compounds.)
2.When hydrogen istaken asthestandard, thevalence oftheele-
ments increases regularly fromGroup ItoGroup IVandthen de-
creases toGroup VII.
3.When oxygen istaken asthestandard, thevalence increases
regularly fromGroup ItoGroup VII.
4.Metallic (basic) elements occur onthe leftandnon-metallic
(acidic) elements occur ontheright.
5.Metallic characteristics increase from top tobottom inany
given group.
6.Themembers ofagroup resemble oneanother, butthemembers
ofafamily inthegroup aremore closely related.
7.Astudy ofonetypical member ofeachgroup furnishes much
information about theother members.
8.Amove inanydirection from francium (No. 87), results ina
decrease inthemetallic nature oftheelements.
9.Amove inanydirection from fluorine (No. 9)results inanin-
crease inmetallic characteristics.
Importance. The periodic classification oftheelements greatly
simplified thestudy oftheir physical andchemical properties. In
addition, thediscovery ofnewelements, aspredicted byMendeleeff,
wasmade possible. Theelement now called germanium (named eka-
silicon byMendeleeff) isanexample oftheclose relation between
prediction and fact.

Another important roleplayed bythesystem brought about the
correction oftheatomic weights ofcertain elements. Before the
classification wasmade, thediscrepancies were notsonoticeable, but
when theelements became associated ingroups individual differences
weremore evident.
Imperfections inthePeriodic Classification. There areseveral de-
fects inthepresent periodic classification andmany attempts have
beenmade torevise it.

Occurrence. Because ofthegreat activity ofsodium, itisnever
found free innature, butalways inchemical combination. Themost
common source ofsodium iscommon salt(Chapter 20).Other natur-
ally occurring compounds containing sodium are,sodium nitrate
(NaN0 3),borax (Na 2B407.10H20),andcryolite (Na3AlF 6).

THEALKALI METALS 241
Preparation. Sodium isprepared bytheelectrolysis ofeither fused
sodium chloride orfused sodium hydroxide. These substances, when
fused, aregood conductors ofelectricity, andbecause nowater is
present thesodium produced canbeeasily collected ifairisexcluded
from thereceiver.
IntheDowns process, a
direct current ofelectricity,
passed through fused sodium
chloride, causes chlorine tobe
liberated atacentral carbon
anode, while thesodium col-
lects ataring-shaped cathode
surrounding theanode. The
chlorine collects inaspecially
designed compartment above
theanode, andthesodium,
being lighter than thefused
salt risesandoverflows into
aseparate container.Fig. 23.1.ADowns cell.Theproducts
ofelectrolysis offused sodium chloride are
sodium andchlorine.
2NaCl—*2Na+Cl2
IntheCastner process, adirect current ofelectricity ispassed
through fused caustic soda inaniron container. Thesodium is
attracted toanironcathode, situated inthecentre ofthe cell.Globules
ofsodium, andhydrogen gas, riseand collect inabell-shaped vessel
ofiron.Thehydrogen serves tokeep airaway from thesodium.
Oxygen, liberated atanickel-iron anode surrounding thecathode,
escapes through anopening inthelidofthecontainer.
2NaOH >2Na+H2+02
Properties. Sodium isasoft, silvery-white solid. Itmelts at97-5° C.

burns vigorously with ayellow flame forming amixture ofitstwo
oxides.
4Na+02>2Na20

Itcombines directly with thehalogens forming thecorresponding
halides (NaCl, NaBr, Nal). Sodium reacts vigorously with water,
forming sodium hydroxide andhydrogen.

242 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Because ofitsvigorous action
withoxygen and water, so-
dium isstored inkerosene or
other oilswithwhich itisin-
active.
Uses. Metallic sodium has
little practical use. Itisthe
direct source ofalimited
number ofimportant com-
pounds (e.g.sodium peroxide),
andsodium-vapour lamps are
gaining inimportance for
highway illumination.
Test. Sodium vapour im-
parts acharacteristic yellow
colour tothenon-luminous flame ofburning hydrogen. Thissame
yellow colour isproduced whenever anysodium compound isvolatilized
inanon-luminous flame. Hence ifaclean piece ofplatinum wire is
dipped intoaconcentrated solution ofanysodium compound andheld
inanon-luminous flame, ayellow colour willbeobserved.
SODIUM COMPOUNDS
Sodium oxide (Na20)isformed bytheslow oxidation ofsodium in
alimited current ofairattemperatures between 200°C.and400°C.
Itisawhite amorphous mass which reacts violently withwater to
formsodium hydroxide.
Na 20+HoO >2NaOH
Sodium peroxide (Na202)isformed when sodium burns inexcess of
airoroxygen. Itisayellow solid which, onstanding exposed toair,
turns white because oftheformation ofsodium hydroxide and finally
sodium carbonate. When water isadded tosodium peroxide, the
solution becomes strongly alkaline andthere isarapid evolution of
oxygen gas.
2Na 202+2HoO >4NaOH+02
Sodium chloride isofsuchgreat importance thataseparate chapter
(Chapter 20)hasbeen assigned toitsstudy.
Sodium carbonate isoneofthemostimportant sodium compounds.
Itspreparation fromsodium chloride bytheSolvay, orammonia-soda,
process constitutes amajor chemical industry. Itissoluble inwater,
giving astrongly alkaline solution. Thedecahydrate, Na 2C0 3.10H20,Fig. 23.2.ACastner cell.Theproducts

commonly known aswashing soda, isusedonalarge scale inthe
softening ofwater, and forthemanufacture ofglass, soap, textiles,
baking soda, andcaustic soda.
Sodium bicarbonate isalsoproduced bytheSolvay process, and is
soluble inwater, giving amild alkaline solution. Itisusedmedicinally
tocorrect excess stomach acidity, andinbaking asbaking soda, oras
oneofthecomponents ofbaking powder.
Sodium nitrate, orChile saltpetre, ismore important asacompound
ofnitrogen than asasodium compound. Itliberates oxygen readily
when heated, but itisnotsatisfactory foruseingunpowder because it
ishygroscopic.
2NaNOs >2NaN0 2+02
Itisused inconsiderable quantities asafertilizer, inthemanufacture
ofnitric acid,and inthepreparation ofordinary saltpetre.
Sodium hydroxide isingreatdemand inindustry because ofits
versatility andlow price. Itisprepared bytheelectrolysis ofbrine.
Itisawhite, brittle, deliquescent solidwhich produces avery strong
base insolution. Acommercial product, containing about24% water,
isknown ascaustic sodaandhasavery corrosive action onorganic
matter andmany other substances. Awater solution ofsodium
hydroxide, sometimes designated assoda lyeorlye,hasasoapy feel,
abitter taste, isagood conductor ofelectricity anddissolves grease
andother matter ofplant andanimal origin. Sodium hydroxide is
used inthemanufacture ofsoap, rayon, textiles, petroleum products,
andmany other chemicals. Since itisdeliquescent, itisused toremove
moisture from gases, and, because itreacts with carbon dioxide to
formsodium carbonate, itisalsoused toremove carbon dioxide from
air(e.g. insubmarines and inbasal metabolism tests).
Sodium silicate (Na 2Si0 3)isvery soluble inwater, andaconcen-
trated solution issoldunder thename of“water glass”. Thiscom-
modity preserves eggs,and italsoserves asafiller insome soaps, asa
coating tofireproof wood and textiles, andasanadhesive cement for
glassandporcelain.
Sodium thiosulphate (Na2S203.5H20)(hypo), forms white, trans-
lucent, well-defined hexagonal crystals. Ithasatendency toremain
indefinitely inastate ofsupersaturation, and forthisreason isa
valuable compound inthelaboratory study ofsupersaturated solu-
tions. Inindustry, itisused extensively asanantichlor intheremoval

POTASSIUM
Occurrence. Potassium isanessential constituent oftheminerals
feldspar andmica, and iswidely distributed inrocks, soil,andsaline
residues from former inland lakes. Themost important deposits of
potassium compounds arefound atStassfurt, Germany; Alsace;
Poland; Searles Lake inCalifornia; and inanarea ofabout 50,000
square miles inNewMexico andTexas. Ineach ofthese deposits,
potassium chloride isthemost plentiful andalsothemost important
compound.
Preparation. Potassium isprepared bytheelectrolysis offused
potassium chloride orpotassium hydroxide bythesame methods as
areused forsodium.
Properties. Potassium isasoft, silvery-blue solid. Because ofits
vigorous action withoxygen andwater, itisstored inkerosene or
other oils.When placed onwater, thereaction produces enough heat
tocause theliberated hydrogen toburn.
Uses. Other than being aninteresting element tostudy inthe
laboratory, potassium hasfewuses. Certain ofitssalts, however, are
very valuable asfertilizers andexplosives.
Test. Potassium vapour imparts aviolet colour toanon-luminous
flame.Aclean piece ofplatinum wire, dipped intoaconcentrated
solution ofanypotassium compound and held inanon-luminous
flame, willgiveacharacteristic violet colour.
POTASSIUM COMPOUNDS
Most potassium compounds aresosimilar totheirsodium counter-
parts that little space willbegiven totheir study.
Potassium hydroxide, orcaustic potash, ismanufactured by
methods similar tothose outlined forsodium hydroxide. Itisused in
making “soft” and“liquid” soaps.
Potassium chloride, with properties similar tothose ofsodium
chloride, isused extensively asasource ofother potassium compounds
andasafertilizer. Commercial fertilizers show theimportance ofthe
elements nitrogen, phosphorus, andpotassium (“N-P-K”) being sold
onapercentage basis content. Forexample, a3-9-5 fertilizer contains
3%available nitrogen, 9%available phosphorus, and5%available
potassium.
Potassium nitrate, known assaltpetre, ornitre, isdescribed earlier.
Potassium chlorate isagood oxidizing agent and isused inthe
laboratory preparation ofoxygen. Itisused inthemanufacture of
fireworks, matches, andexplosives because itreadily decomposes to

tooth pastes.
Potassium permanganate (KMn0 4),because ofitsoxidizing proper-
ties, isused medicinally both asadisinfectant andadeodorant. It
bleaches resins, fats,waxes, oils,straw, cotton, silk,andchamois skins.

Nitrogen doesnotreact readily withanyoftheelements. Therefore,
although 78percent oftheatmosphere isnitrogen, there arefewof
itsmineral compounds onearth. However, many organic compounds,
containing nitrogen, arebuiltupbyplants which utilize theproducts
ofthe lifeactivities ofnitrogen-fixing bacteria inthe soil,thecarbo-
hydrates manufactured intheir leaves, and soil minerals. These

complex organic compounds, containing nitrogen, arecalled proteins.
Animals eatplant proteins, andbytheprocesses ofdigestion and
absorption, aswellasbyother chemical changes, rearrange theatoms
intoanimal proteins such asarefound inblood, bone, andmuscle.
Foods, supplying much ofourproteins, areleanmeats, nuts, peas,
beans, cheese, eggs,andmilk.From thewaste products ofanimals and
plants, andfrom thedecay, ordecomposition oftheirremains nitrogen
isreturned totheair.This nitrogen mayagain be“fixed” intheform
ofsome simple nitrogen compound bytheaction ofbacteria and
again bemade available forthehigher plants. This chain ofevents
maintains thebalance between nitrogen intheairand living things,
and iscalled thenitrogen cycle.
Man hasalsodevised methods offixing free nitrogen. Nitrogen
fixation isaccomplished inindustry intwodifferent ways, depending
onwhether atmospheric nitrogen ismade tocombine withhydrogen
toformammonia, orwithoxygen toform nitric oxide.Adiscussion
ofthese syntheses follows.

Thepure gas,however, wasnotcollected andidentified until Priestley,
bymeans ofhispneumatic trough, collected itovermercury in1774.
Occurrence. Because ammonia isaproduct ofthedecay oforganic
matter containing nitrogen, traces ofitarefound intheair,andtraces
ofammonia solution arepresent inmost natural waters.
Preparation. Ammonia canbeprepared inthelaboratory byheating
anyammonium compound withanybase. Usually ammonium chloride
andslaked limeareused (Fig. 24.2).
Properties. Ammonia isacolourless gaswith acharacteristic,
pungent odour. Itcanbeeasily liquefied and islessdense than air
(17:28-9). Itissoluble inwater, onevolume ofwater at0°C.and
standard pressure dissolving 1,298volumes ofthegastogiveasolution

works ammonia. During thede-
structive distillation ofcoal,an
alkaline liquid, known as“gas
liquor”, isformed. This contains
ammonium saltsand freeammo-
niaand,when heated with slaked
lime, yields ammonia gas,which
canbeeither dissolved inwater or

Thenitrogen isobtained bythefractional distillation ofliquid air,and
thehydrogen usually from theelectrolysis ofbrine. This industrial
preparation wasperfected byaGerman chemist, Fritz Haber. Inthe
Haber process, amixture ofnitrogen andhydrogen, under apressure
of200atmospheres, ispassed through steel tubes electrically heated
to500°C.Finely divided ironorironoxide isused asacatalyst. The
resulting ammonia isdissolved inwater.
3.Cyanamide process. Ifcalcium carbide isheated electrically for
about 48hours while nitrogen under pressure ispassed over it,calcium
cyanamide andcarbon areformed.
CaC 2-f-N2—>CaCN 2-FC
Although most ofthecyanamide isused directly asafertilizer, some
ofitisused inthepreparation ofammonia. Todothis,calcium cyana-
mide ismixed inautoclaves withwater andsodium hydroxide, and
steam under pressure isblown in.
CaCN 2+3H20->CaC0 3+2NHS
Uses.Ammonia isused inthemanufacture ofwashing sodabythe
Solvay process, and intheproduction ofnitric acidandnitrates, and
thesubsequent manufacture ofexplosives.
Because itcanbesoeasily liquefied, andbecause ofitshighheat
ofvaporization (326 cal.pergm.),ammonia isused inrefrigeration.
Thegas isfirstcondensed under pressure andtherapid evaporation of
theliquid, resulting from thesudden release ofpressure, causes an
absorption ofheatwhereby thesurrounding area iscooled.
Anaqueous solution ofammonia, called household ammonia,
contains about6%ammonia gasbyweight, and isused inthelaundry
andforhousehold cleaning.
Ammonium compounds areprepared either bythedirect union of
ammonia with acids orbytheneutralization ofammonium hydroxide
solution. They allcontain theradicalNH 4which behaves likeametal
inchemical reactions. Allammonium salts aresoluble inwater and
allareeasily decomposed byheat.Ammonium carbonate haslargely
replaced theaqueous solution ofammonia asahousehold cleaning
agent because itiseasier tohandle andyields ammonia readily. The

NITRIC ACID (UNO,)
Nitric acidwasknown tothealchemists asaqua fortis (strong
water). They obtained itbyheating together saltpetre andsome
hydrated sulphate such asgreen vitriol (FeS0 4.7H20).
Preparation. There arethree important methods used intheprep-
aration ofnitric acid.
1.From Chile saltpetre. Inthelaboratory, nitric acid isprepared by
heating anitrate with concentrated sulphuric acid. Chile saltpetre
(sodium nitrate) iscommonly usedbecause itisthecheapest ofallthe
nitrates. When concentrated sulphuric acidandsodium nitrate are
placed intheretort (Fig. 24.4), noreaction takes place, but ifthe
mixture isgently heated, effervescence intheliquid isobserved.
Nitric acid boils at86°C.andsulphuric acidat338° C.,sothatwhile
thenitric acidvapour isdriven offandcondensed, thetemperature is
nothighenough tovaporize thesulphuric acid. Because nitric acid
attacks both rubber and cork, theretort must beequipped with a
glass stopper. This method, employing larger retorts and special
condensers, isthatused industrially. Theresidue intheretort crystal-
lizes toformsodium bisulphate.

252 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
2.Bytheoxidation ofnitrogen athigh temperatures. When air is
heated to3500° C.,about5%ofitisconverted intoagascalled nitric
oxide. This combination oftwo ofthecomponents ofair isatrue
nitrogen fixation. Theresulting cooled nitric oxide oxidizes inmore air
toform nitrogen dioxide, andthis isdissolved inwater toform nitric
acid. This process, however, issowasteful ofelectrical energy that,
even inplaces where electricity isvery cheap, itisbeing displaced by
themore economical oxidation ofsynthetic ammonia.
3.Bytheoxidation ofammonia (Ostwald Process ).Inthepresence
ofasuitable catalyst (usually red-hot platinum), ammonia andoxygen
react toform nitric acidandwater. The reactions, although complex,
mayberepresented byonesimple equation :
NH3+202HN03+H20
Properties. The acid solution iscolourless; theyellow colour so
often seen iscaused bytheliberation ofnitrogen dioxide. Commercial
concentrated nitric acidcontains about68%HN0 3.Ifadrop ofsuch
acid isplaced in10cc.ofwater, thedilute solution willhave asour
taste, turn blue litmus red,neutralize abase,andshow most ofthe
other characteristics ofanacid solution. Nitric acid ionizes toahigh
degree and istherefore, astrong acid. Inaddition, theconcentrated
acid isvery corrosive tofleshandclothing.
Nitric acid isnotvery stable. When heated orexposed tosunlight,
itdecomposes toform water, nitrogen dioxide, andoxygen. Hence,
nitric acid, particularly when hot, isanexcellent oxidizing agent.
4HN0342H20+4N0 2+02
This oxidizing property explains itspeculiar reaction with metals-
With zincandother metals above hydrogen intheactivity series, and
dilute acid, onewould expect togethydrogen; however, water and
nothydrogen isobtained. This isbecause ofthestrong oxidizing
property ofthenitric acid.Anyhydrogen atoms setfreeareimmedi-
ately oxidized towater.

Nitric acid willalsooxidize non-metals such assulphur andcarbon
toform sulphuric acidandcarbon dioxide, respectively. Italsoacts
asapowerful oxidizer with proteins, including skin,which itturns a
yellow colour. Theaddition ofammonium hydroxide intensifies the
yellow colour toorange. These reactions areused asatestforproteins.
Uses.Byfarthemost important useofnitric acid isinthemanu-
facture ofexplosives. Other uses
include thepreparation ofdyes,
drugs, photographic films, fertiliz-
ers,andsome plastics. Itisalso
used toetch zincandcopper plates
inpreparing “cuts” toprint artists’
illustrations (such asFig. 24.5).
Explosions arecaused bythe
sudden formation andexpansion of
hugevolumes ofgases. Violent ex-
plosions occurwhen solids orliquids
suddenly change intogases ofse-
veral hundred times their volume.
Heat formed from these exother-
micreactions causes theliberated
gases toexpand stillmore. The
most important explosive used to-
daywas discovered byAntonio
Sobrero, anItalian. Itisglyceryl
trinitrate, commonly known as
nitroglycerine, andmade byheat-
ing nitric acid with glycerine, a
by-product ofthesoap industry.
This pale, oily liquid wastoosensitive tobeused indiscriminately
forlarge-scale blasting until Alfred Nobel found that,byabsorbing
itinaporous material, itwasrendered relatively safe.Thisproduct is
called dynamite. Dynamite andother explosives have greatly altered
ourmode ofliving. Anendless listcould becompiled ofthepeace-
time benefits brought totheworld bythevarying uses ofexplosives.
Innocountry canthisbebetter demonstrated than inCanada. Min-
ing,oneofourmost important industries, makes thegreatest useof
explosives andemploys many specialized types. Approximately 30,000
blasts aresetoffevery day inCanadian mines. Inthefishing industry,
many tons ofexplosives areused annually forbreaking icesothat
sealing andwhaling shipsmay reach their hunting grounds. IntheFig.24.5 Alfred Nobel (1833-1896),

lumbering industry, explosives clear therights-of-way, blow out
stumps, andbreak uplogjams. Thefarmer employs explosives to
clear theland ofstumps,
andtoopen drainage ditch-
es.Inthecity, explosives
aresometimes useful in
wrecking buildings, uproot-
ingconcrete foundations,
felling oldchimneys, and
excavating forlarge foun-
dations. Canada’s great
railways, with their thou-
sands ofrock cutsand
tunnels, could nothave

ofexplosives.
Most ofourmodern explosives aremanufactured bytreating some
organic compound with nitric acid. Inaddition tonitroglycerine,
these include cellulose nitrate (gun cotton), cordite, picric acid, mer-
curic fulminate, lyddite, andtrinitrotoluene (T.N.T.).
Nitrates. Nitrates aremadeby
theaction ofnitric acidonametal,
ametal oxide, anhydroxide, ora
carbonate. They are allsoluble in
water and,when heated, lose
oxygen tobecome nitrites. The
most important nitrates arethose
ofammonium, sodium, potassium,
and silver. Sodium nitrate (Na
NO?), sometimes called Chile
saltpetre, orcubic nitrate, because
itcrystallizes incubes, isfound in
itsnatural state indesert regions,
particularly inChile. Itisadeliquescent salt,and isused inthepre-
paration ofnitric acidandasafertilizer. Potassium nitrate (KN0 3),
nitre, orsaltpetre, crystallizes inlong needle-like crystals. Itisformed
bythedecay oforganic matter, andappears onmanure andother
refuse asawhite crystal salt. Saltpetre isstillmanufactured bythis
method inIndia andSweden. However, thechief source today lies
inthereaction ofasolution ofhotconcentrated Chile saltpetre witha
hotconcentrated solution ofpotassium chloride.

Calcium andMagnesium
Twodrams ofchalk were converted intoaperfect quick-lime, and
losttwoscruples andtwelve grains inthe fire.This quick-lime was
slaked ...withanounce ofwater.
Joseph Black(1755)
Calcium andmagnesium aremembers ofafamily ofelements
known inthetime ofthealchemists asearths andsubsequently called
alkaline earths since they giveanalkaline reaction with water. They
occur inGroup IIofthePeriodic Classification, have apositive
valence oftwo, react withwater liberating hydrogen, produce oxides
thatreact withwater toform bases, anddisplace hydrogen from acids.
Calcium compounds aremorecommon thanmagnesium compounds
andhave greater useineveryday life.Magnesium metal, however,
isbecoming increasingly important because italloys readily with
other metals, andcannowbeproduced cheaply bythePidgeon process
from theextensive deposits ofdolomite (CaC0 3•MgC0 3)occurring
inCanada.
CALCIUM
Occurrence. Calcium isnotfound free innature butoccurs abund-
antly asaconstituent ofcalcium carbonate insuch familiar substances
aslimestone, marble, andchalk. Other important compounds, widely
distributed across Canada, aregypsum, CaS04 .2
H20;calcium phos-
phate, Ca 3(P0 4)2;fluorite, CaF 2;andapatite 3Ca 3(P0 4)2.CaF 2.
Preparation. Metallic calcium isprepared bypassing adirect
current ofelectricity through fused calcium chloride inagraphite
crucible serving asananode. Calcium forms ononeendofaniron
cathode justtouching thesurface ofthefused chloride, andasthe
calcium increases inthickness thecathode isgradually raised pro-
ducing along“cabbage stalk” ofcalcium whichmaybepurified by
distilling inavacuum.
Properties anduses. Calcium isasilvery-white metal having a
specific gravity of1-55andamelting point of810°C.Itburns inair
with abrick-red flame toform amixture ofitsoxide and nitride.
Calcium readily decomposes cold water, liberating hydrogen inthe
process andleaving adeposit oftheslightly soluble hydroxide.

Calcium oxide (CaO). Calcium
oxide (lime orquicklime) ispre-
pared byheating limestone in
kilns (Fig. 25.1). Pure lime is
white, porous, and resistant to
heat.When heated toatemperature of1800° C., itgives offabril-

Quicklime hasmore than fiftycommon industrial uses, but itsmost
important oneconcerns themanufacture ofslaked lime.
Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2).
Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) is
awhite powder sparingly soluble
incoldwater, and,contrary tothe
usual rules ofsolubility, less sol-
uble inwarm water. Itssolution, a
base, isknown aslimewater. A
suspension ofcalcium hydroxide in
water iscalled milk oflimeand is
sometimes used as“whitewash”.
Calcium hydroxide isused exten-
sively inthemaking ofmortar,
plaster, andbleaching powder, with
more limited uses inremoving
hairfrom hides, softening water
oftemporary hardness, and inthe
manufacture ofother chemicals.
Mortar. Mortar isamixture ofslaked lime, sand, andwater.When
itisplaced between bricks, itsporous nature permits permeation of
carbon dioxide from the air,with theresulting formation ofhard,
insoluble calcium carbonate which binds theporous bricks together
Ca(OH) 2+C0 2—*CaC0 3+H20
The original water, together with thewater produced bythereaction,
evaporates intothe air.
Plaster. Plaster isessentially thesame asmortar. Hair, orwood
fibre, isadded tomake themixture cling together better, andhardening
maybepromoted byburning charcoal inspecial burners, aprocedure
often followed infreshly plastered rooms.

rence isthesoftmineral gypsum, CaS0 4.2H20.Itmaybewhite or
tinted with various colours. Itsprincipal use isinthemanufacture of

150° C.,three-quarters ofthewater ofhydration isdriven off,anda
white powder, known asplaster ofParis, isleft.

Test. Calcium compounds, when volatilized, impart abrick-red
colour toanon-luminous flame.Aclean platinum wiredipped inany
calcium compound moistened with hydrochloric acid willgive this
same colour when held inanon-luminous flame.
MAGNESIUM
The chief uses ofmagnesium areinthemanufacture oflight alloys
fortheconstruction ofairplane parts, andother equipment where
strength andlightness aredesired. Itmaybecastandused inhouse-
hold appliances andcooking utensils. The activity offinely divided
magnesium finds practical useinflash-light powders, military flares,
incendiary bombs, andpyrotechnics. When magnesium isconnected
tounderground iron pipe lines orinserted inhotwater tanks, it
corrodes before thelessactive iron isaffected; thus, thelife-span of
theiron isgreatly increased.
There aretwocommon methods ofabstracting magnesium from its
compounds. The first istheelectrolysis offusedmagnesium chloride,
ofwhich substance there isaninexhaustible supply insea-water; the
second isamethod recently developed inCanada byDr.L.M.Pidgeon
whereby theabundant supplies ofdolomite areused.
Magnesium isasilvery -white, malleable metal. Itoxidizes and
tarnishes inmoist airbecause oftheformation ofabasic carbonate,
butindryairitisstable. Inthefinely divided form, itcanbeignited

THEHARDNESS OFWATER
Water issaid tobehardwhen itreacts withsoap toform awhite
insoluble curd before producing alather. Such water feels harsh to
theskin.Water issoftwhen itreadily lathers with soap.Soap consists
ofthesodium orpotassium salts ofcertain organic acids derived from
fats.Soaps aresoluble inwater andshow aremarkable tendenc}' to
form “suds”, helpful inremoving grease from skinandclothing by
emulsification.
Cause ofhardness. Hard water contains much dissolved matter,
especially salts ofcalcium andmagnesium,present asthebicarbonates,
sulphates, and chlorides. Insome localities, soluble iron saltsaddtothe
hardness ofthewater. Forpurposes ofconvenience, hardness is
classified astemporary andpermanent.
Temporary hardness. Water issaidtobetemporarily hardwhen the
hardness canberemoved byboiling. Temporary hardness may be
referred toascarbonate hardness because itisattributable tothebi-
carbonates ofcalcium andmagnesium. Itisremoved byboiling be-
cause these soluble bicarbonates aredecomposed toform thenormal
carbonates which, being insoluble, precipitate outofsolution and
therefore donotreact with soap.

Ca(HC03)2—*CaC0 3C0 2-TH20
Calcium bicarbonate isaunique compound inthat itcanexist only
insolution. Itspresence inhardwater isexplained bythedissolving
action ofcarbonic acid on
limestone. Carbonic acid is
formed when rain dissolves
carbon dioxide from the air.
Additional carbon dioxide is
added toground water bythe
respiration ofaquatic life,and
from thedecomposition ofor-
ganic materials. Coming in
contact withlimestone insoils
oronlakebottoms, etc., the
carbonic acid reacts with cal-
cium carbonate toform the
soluble bicarbonate which dis-
solves inthewater.

Underground water atdepth,
and sounder considerable
pressure, usually isrich indis-
solved carbon dioxide (carbo-
nicacid), andtherefore cap-
able ofdissolving agreat deal ofcalcium carbonate. Hence, in
some limestone regions huge underground caverns haveformed asa
result ofthousands ofyears ofthisdissolving action. Water seeping
through theroofs ofsuch caverns releases some carbon dioxide be-
cause ofthesudden decrease inpressure, andlimestone comes outof
solution causing stalactites tohang from theroof. Stalagmites may
formonthefloorbecause oftheevaporation ofthefallen water.
Permanent hardness. Because non-carbonate hardness cannot be
removed byboiling, itiscalled permanent hardness. Itiscaused by
thepresence ofthesulphates andchlorides ofcalcium andmagnesium
insolution, andboiling doesnotremove thehardness since these are
notaffected byheating. Toremove permanent hardness itisnecessary
toaddsome chemical capable ofprecipitating thecalcium andmag-
nesium intheform ofinsoluble compounds. One ofthecheapest andLuray Caverns

The discoveries ofyesterday, though miracles intheirown right,

been receiving essential supplies ofalkali fortheir glass factories from
Spain, butwhen theBritish cutoffthissupply from reaching France,
theFrench Academy offered aprize of100,000 francs foraprocess
ensuring aplentiful supply ofsoda ash. In1784, Nicolas Leblanc
started workontheproblem, andafter three years ofexperimentation
anddeliberate planning, heevolved aprocess whereby sodium carbo-
natecould beproduced fromcommon saltandsulphuric acid.Asimple
equation willshow thatsodium sulphate isaproduct ofthisreaction:
2NaCl+H2S0 4 2HC1+Na2S0 4
However, Leblanc showed thatwhen sodium sulphate washeated
withcokeandlimestone, sodium carbonate wasproduced andcould
beisolated byextraction with water:
Na2S0 4+2C+CaC03>2C0 2+CaS+Na 2C0 3
Atareasonable price, caustic sodacould beobtained from thesodium
carbonate bytreating itwith slaked lime:

Leblanc wasunique inthathedidnotdiscover something justby
accident from thethen-known industrial chemistry. Rather, byde-
liberate logical reasoning, heused industrial chemistry, asitwasknown
tohim, tocreate something new.
Leblanc’s history-making discovery illustrates two characteristic
features ofchemical industry. Inthe first place, while Leblanc was
working toimprove theeconomic status ofFrance, andatthesame
time tobolster hisowneconomic position, hehadnoidea ofthe
number ofnew industries tobeborn because ofhissingle discovery.
Tociteonlyoneexample: soapwasaluxury enjoyed onlybyafew
because itsmanufacture required astrong, expensive alkali, butwith
theappearance ofacheap base, anexpanding soap industry brought
anewconcept ofpersonal hygiene tothemasses, along withanew
andcheaper method ofwhitening cloth without sunshine. More
alkalidemanded more sulphuric acid;sonewandbetter methods were
required notonly fortheproduction oftheacidbutfor allofthe
related chemicals, andhence agreat expansion occurred inalarge
number offields. Inthesecond place, remarkable aswasLeblanc’s
discovery, hisprocess wassoon discarded forthenewand better
Solvay process formaking sodium carbonate. Today, soap isfacing
thecompetition ofdetergents or“soapless soaps”, and ifthesenew
products prove their superiority, chemical industry willseetoitthat
soapmeets thesame fateasdidtheLeblanc soda process. New sub-
stances willalways replace old,unsatisfactory ones.
While Leblanc gave chemical industry itsstart inthe18thcentury,
the19th century marked aperiod ofphenomenal growth inbasic
discoveries. Analine, the firstsynthetic dyefrom coal tar,was dis-
covered in1856byWilliam Henry Perkin. In1863, Ernest Solvay
introduced analkali process using salt,carbon dioxide, andammonia
asbasic materials. The ironand steel industries expanded quickly,
and itwasdiscovered that foul-smelling petroleum or“burning oil’
could besubjected tofractional distillation toproduce ahost of
valuable and, heretofore, unknown products. Volta, in1810, estab-
lished theprinciple ofelectrolysis, andbytheend ofthecentury
electrical power hadbeen developed atNiagara Falls, enabling
Charles Martin Hall toperfect anelectrolytic process forproducing
cheap aluminum. Frasch succeeded inbringing sulphur from under-
ground bythesurprisingly simple method ofmelting itwithhotwater
andforcing ittothesurface bymeans ofcompressed air.

CELLULOSE PRODUCTS
Ever since thehuman racewas initsinfancy, menhavedepended
uponwoodandcotton. They haveburned wood forfuel,andconverted
itinto furniture, houses, boats, paper, andmany other products. By
distilling itintheabsence ofair,theyhave obtained wood alcohol,
charcoal, acetic acid, tar,andother valuable products. They have
made cotton intosuchproducts ascloth, paper, andsurgical dressings.
Cellulose began itscareer asachemical rawmaterial in1845when
“guncotton”, ornitrocellulose, was firstproduced. Theachievements
inthis field ofchemistry, likethose inthefield ofplastics, have been
sophenomenal thatspace doesnotpermit arecording ofthem. The
above chart, taken from“The Story ofCellulose” byE. I.duPont
deNemours &Co., gives aglimpse ofthepossibilities ofcellulose
chemistry.

group ofmaterials which consist of,orcontain asanessential in-
gredient, anorganic substance oflarge molecular weight, andwhich
while solid inthefinished state, atsome stage initsmanufacture has
been orcanbeformed intovarious shapes byflow, usually through
application singly ortogether ofheatandpressure.”
Thecommittee reaffirms thestatement made previously that the
origin ofplastics isanother example oftheage-old search fornewand
better materials toreplace natural ones, ortoperform functions more
satisfactorily than materials already inuse.
In1868, aprizewasoffered forasubstitute forivory fromwhich
billiard ballsweremade. JohnWesley Hyatt, aprinter fromAlbany,
NewYork, devised amethod ofmixing cellulose nitrate withcamphor,
andtheresultant product, celluloid,became the firstcommercially
accepted plastic. In1895, shellac was utilized tomake phonograph
records, and in1909 Dr.Baekeland, aBelgian chemist living inthe
United States, produced aplastic from phenol (carbolic acid) and
formaldehyde, capable ofbeing molded under heatandpressure into
avariety ofproducts. In1919, casein plastics, made from theprotein
ofskim milkandformaldehyde, became acommercial product. Since
1925, atremendous increase intheannual production ofplastics has
occurred.
Plastics aredivided intotwogeneral types, viz.thermosetting and
thermoplastic resins. “Thermo” means heat, hence thethermosetting
group comprises those plastics which setorharden intopermanent
shapewhen heatandpressure areapplied tothem, whereas thethermo-
plastic group includes those that aresoftened byheatandthen
hardened intoshape bycooling. Both ofthese types arelight inweight,

NYLON
Ittook$27,000,000.00 and10years’ work toplace the firststrands
ofnylon onthemarket.
The story ofnylon goesback to1928when agroup ofresearch
chemists oftheDuPontCompany intheUnited States, ledbyDr.
W.H.Carothers, undertook aprogram ofwhat they called “funda-
mental research”. Their workwasnotaimed atthecreation ofnew
chemical products ortheimprovement ofexisting ones. Instead, they
hoped todiscover newandfundamental factsabout chemical materials
andprocesses thatwould addtothebasic knowledge necessary toall
chemical advancement.
Dr.Carothers and hisassistants were particularly curious about
howandwhy certain molecules, ofwhich allthings aremade, often
CHEMISTRY ININDUSTRY 279
unite toform “giant” molecules. Many ofthese giant molecules exist
innature andaretheprincipal building blocks ofsuchwell-known
substances ascotton, rubber, silkand resins.
One ofthefacts thescientists uncovered aftermonths ofworkwas
thatthey couldmake inthelaboratory anewtype ofgiant molecule
that differed from thoseknown toexist innature, inthat itwasmade
upofmolecules joined together inanorderly end-to-end manner,
much likeachain ofpaper clips.
In1930, while investigating thisnewdiscovery, oneofthechemists
made astartling observation. Heremoved asample containing these
giant molecules from thechemical still inwhich ithadbeenmade and
noted that themolten sample could bestretched likewarm taffy
candy. Even after ithadcooled, itstillcould bestretched tothree or
fourtimes itsoriginal length.
More important, thechemist sawthatwhen thesample was so
drawn itbecame much stronger andmore elastic, adevelopment never
before seen insuchsubstances. Thechemist wondered whether itmight
notmake anexcellent textile yarn.
After studying thesenewcompounds forseven years, thechemists
were finally able toproduce greatly improved substances known as
“linear polymers”. These appeared onthemarket in1938 asbristles
fortooth brushes andproved superior inmany ways tonatural
bristles. Then, with theco-operation ofthehosiery industry, ayarn
suitable forwomen’s stockings wasdeveloped; onMay 15,1940, the
firstnylon stockings wentonsale.
Nylon proved stronger, tougher, andmore durable than any
natural fibre. Itwasfound toresist abrasion, damage bymoths or
mildew, hadgreat dimensional stability andhighwetstrength, and
waseasy tolaunder, quick to-dry,and light towear orcarry.
Asitsunique qualities became better known, nylon, asayarn,
staple fibreand plastic, wasquickly adopted inother fields. Today, it
isused inhundreds ofproducts found inhome andfactory, ranging
frombabygarments andstockings toropes forrope-driven machinery.
Construction ofaCanadian nylon plant began in1940, andthe
firstnylon made inCanada came offthemachines attheKingston,
Ontario, plant ofCanadian Industries Limited onJune 26,1942.
Themanufacture ofnylon isacomplicated chemical process.
Basically, the fibre isderived from coal, air,andwater, beginning
with theproduction ofbenzene from coal tar,nitrogen andoxygen
from the air,andhydrogen from water.
Combined andsubjected under exacting control toasuccession of
chemical reactions, theresulting product isnylon saltwhich issoluble
280 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
inwater, theform inwhich itusually istransported orstored.
Thesecond major step istoconvert thenylon saltfrom aliquid to
asolid.The solution ispumped from storage tanks toanevaporator
andthence toagiant pressure cooker called anautoclave. Here, the
molecules ofthenylon saltarejoined end-to-end toform thevery
large molecules called superpolymers. These help togivenylon its
toughness and elasticity.
Themolten mass then isextruded through anarrow slitontoa
large polished drum where thewhite ribbon ofnylon issolidified and
cooled bywater sprays thatharden itasitmoves along tothechipper,
arotary cutter thatchops thenylon ribbon intohard, ivory-like flakes
about thesizeofsoap flakes.
Thethirdmajor operation begins when thenylon flakes aredumped
intoahopper, melted, andthemolten nylonpumped through thetiny
holes ofasmall metal plate called aspinneret.
Asthemolten nylon isextruded from each hole, itsolidifies asa
filament. These filaments aretwisted together toform theyarnknown
asmultifilament. The filaments arethenwound onbobbins, com-
pleting theoperation known asspinning.
Theyarn isnext stretched about fourtimes itsoriginal length and
twisted byrunning itthrough adraw-twisting machine. Thisoperation
gives theyarn thestrength, elasticity, translucence, and lustre for
which itisnoted.

tests have indicated thatunder lightandweather exposure orlon

disintegrated.
Inthestaple fibreform orlon produces fabrics which aresufficiently
strong andwarm, without being heavy. These fabrics have themost
wool-like feelandappearance ofanyknown synthetic fibres. Suitings
andovercoatings made from orlon havegood appearance andmake
excellent materials forrugged winter climates. When formed asa

Thechemist hascreated, within asingle generation, ahost ofnew
materials, many possessing seemingly unbelievable properties. Public
acceptance ofrayon, nylon, orlon, andthegreat variety ofother
synthetics indicates thatthese substances canbecommercially success-
ful iftheyhave specific characteristics better than those ofpreviously
known fibres, and iftheycanbemanufactured economically. Chemists,
with their ability tosynthesize newmaterials, willmake possible even
more spectacular fibres, whose properties willbedetermined bythe
precise application forwhich each isrequired.

Most substances canbeclassified inseveral waysandtheelements

Intheclassification dealt with heretheelements aredivided intotwo
groups according totheir ability either togiveuportoaccept electrons

Although hydrogen isnotcon-
sidered tobeametal, itisincluded
intheseries because thehydrogen
ioncarries apositive charge. In
addition, hydrogen canbedisplaced
from dilute acidsbymetals above
itintheseries (seepage 45). This
reaction ispossible because the
metals above hydrogen have a
greater tendency togiveupelec-
trons than has hydrogen, and
hydrogen ionsmusthave agreater
tendency togain electrons toform
hydrogen atoms which combine
toform molecules.
The higher theelement isin
theactivity series, themore active
itis.Theelement displays more
metallic characteristics because of
itsgreater tendency tolose electrons. Themembers ofthe series
below hydrogen willnotreact with dilute acids toliberate hydrogen.
Theelements above hydrogen will allreact withmost dilute acids to
liberate hydrogen. Theupper range oftheseries includes those metals
that react withwater toproduce hydrogen.
The photoelectric cell.Thetendency ofthemost active metals
(cesium, rubidium andpotassium) togiveupelectrons issogreat that
light falling upon thesurface of
themetal willcause electrons tobe
setfreefrom the surface. This
property coupled withthepotential
exerted byanelectric current is
utilized inthephotoelectric cell(Fig.

The electron theory andtheactivity series. When afreemetal
displaces ametal below itintheseries from asolution ofoneofits
soluble compounds, atransfer ofelectrons takes place. The free
metal gives upitselectrons andforms ions,andthemetallic ions in
solution take these electrons andform neutral atoms which appear as
freemetal.

atomic structure, theterm oxidation takes onamuch broader
meaning than given onpage 25where oxidation wasdefined asthe
union ofasubstance with oxygen. The iron intheabove reaction is
oxidized because ithaslostelectrons andincreased inpositive valence,
whereas thecopper hasbeen reduced because thecopper ionshave
gained electrons anddecreased inpositive valence.
Thisconcept ofoxidation andreduction interms ofchange ofvalence
illustrates thatoxidation-reduction reactions maytake place without
thepresence ofoxygen. Forexample, consider theoxidation of
ferrous chloride toferric chloride. Ferrous chloride insolution may
beprepared bytreating ironwith hydrochloric acidand filtering the
mixture. Ifchlorine gas isbubbled through thepalegreen filtrate
containing ferrous chloride, thesolution takes ontheamber colour
characteristic ofasolution offerric chloride.

areknown asminerals. Examples ofthese minerals include hematite
(Fe 203),bauxite (Al203-xH 20)(amixture ofhydrates ofalumina)
andchalcocite (Cu 2S).
When amineral occurs mixed with extraneous rocky orother
material themineral issaid tobecontained inanore. Ifthere isa
high concentration ofthemineral, theproduction ofthemetal from
theorewillbeeconomically profitable. If,however, theconcentration
ofthemineral islow,apreliminary treatment must begiven toget
ridofsome oftheextraneous material. The practical distinction
between amineral andanore istherefore aneconomic one.
Theprocess ofobtaining ametal from itsores iscalled metallurgy.
Certain methods ofproducing thepuremetal havebeen discussed in
previous chapters (seepages 241-242) while methods ofproducing
aluminum, iron,andcopper willbediscussed inChapters 28,29and30.
Before proceeding with astudy ofspecific metallurgical processes, a
general survey ofthemorecommon sources ofmetals willbemade.
Metals inthefree state. Platinum andgoldoresusually consist ofthe
metal inafinely-divided condition found scattered throughout the
waste rocky material (gangue).
Oxides ofmetals. This isacommon type oforeand isthe
starting point foriron,aluminum, and tin.
Sulphides ofmetals. Thesemaybesimple sulphides orcomplex
compounds containing sulphur. The ores ofcopper, lead, mercury,
zinc,cadmium, nickel, andcobalt commonly contain sulphides.
Chlorides ofmetals. Earlier chapters stated thatsodium chloride
occurs inaverypure state asthemineral halite which serves asaraw
material forsodium. Chlorides ofpotassium, magnesium andcalcium
constitute thestarting point forpotassium, magnesium andcalcium.
Concentration (ore-dressing). Costs ofmetallurgical processes are
divided between thesecuring oftheoreandtheprocessing oftheore
until thepuremetal isproduced. Inmany cases theprocessing costs
would beprohibitive were itnotforthediscovery ofsome simple in-
expensive method ofseparating thevaluable mineral from thegangue.
Anyprocess which effectively separates mineral fromgangue isknown
asore-dressing orconcentration andtheproduct resulting from the
process isknown astheconcentrate. There areseveral methods of
producing aconcentrate. Themostcommon method, however,
consists ofgrinding theoreinto particles sosmall thateach particle is
either mineral organgue, then sorting themineral from thegangue by
thefroth-flotation process.
Froth-flotation. Inthefroth-flotation process thepowdered ore,
known aspulp, isfedintoaflotation cell (Fig. 27.7) where small

amounts ofspecial oilsandother
chemicals areintroduced. Air
under pressure, accompanied by
mechanical agitation, produces
afroth towhich thedesired
mineral particles adhere. The
froth containing themineral
rises tothetopoftheopen cell
and isskimmed off.The en-
riched product, theconcentrate,
iscollected inspecial tanks called
launders where itispartially
dried before passing tolarge
drum-like rollers where thedry-
ing iscompleted. Thedrycon-
centrate isthen transported totherefinery.
Application ofthefroth-flotation process tolowgrade copper ores
from certain Canadian mines results intherecovery ofasmuch as
onetonofconcentrate from sixtons ofore. Without this process,
separation would beeconomically impossible.
Metallurgical processes. There areseveral methods ofobtaining
metals from their ores. Themostcommon areasfollows:
Electrolytic processing. Forthose metals high intheactivity series
thatcannot bereduced bycarbon, anelectrolytic method must beused
toproduce themetal. Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and
aluminum areproduced bythismethod.
Reduction bycarbon. Metals inthemiddle ranges oftheseriesmay
beseparated from their oxides byreducing them with carbon. Iron
maybeproduced byreduction ofhematite (Fe 203)withcarbon (p.310).
Roasting and reduction. Insome cases, especially iftheore isa
sulphide, itisnecessary toheattheoreinastream ofairtoconvert the
mineral fromasulphide toanoxide. This process isknown asroasting.
Theoxide isthenreduced withcarbon. Themetallurgies ofcopper and
zincmake useofthismethod ofroasting andreduction.
Extractive metallurgy. This isaprocess usedonlowgrade oresand
consists oftreating theorewith aleaching agent such assulphuric acid
orammonia. Bythismeans themetal isputintoasolution from
which itmayberecovered laterbysubsequent chemical reaction.

CHAPTER 28
Aluminum
Thisproverb flashes through hishead:
Themany fail;theonesucceeds.
Tennyson
Thestory ofaluminum isoneofthemost dramatic inthehistory of
modern chemistry. Achemical curiosity in1825,aluminum hasto-
daybecome ametal ofvital importance.
In1825Hans Christian Oersted, aDanish chemist, produced alumi-
numbyheating aluminum chloride withpotassium amalgam, asolid
solution formed bydissolving potassium inmercury. Two years
later Freidrich Wohler, aGerman chemist andastudent ofBerzelius
(p.118), produced aluminum inasimilar fashion butusedpotassium
metal rather than potassium amalgam. One ofWohler’s students,
Frank Fanning Jewett, achemistry professor atOberlin College in
thestate ofOhio, U.S.A., remarked tohisclass that ifanyone could
invent aprocess toproduce aluminum onacommercial scale, he
would notonly beabenefactor totheworld, butwould make a
fortune. Charles Martin Hall (1863-1914), astudent inthe class,
whispered tohisclassmate, “I’m going forthatmetal”, andfrom that
time on,discovering acheap method ofproducing aluminum became
anobsession with him. Inattacking theproblem, Hall used the
scientific method (page 17)and finally, February 23,1886, reached
hisgoalbyproducing anumber ofsmall globules ofaluminum.
Twomonths after Hall’s discovery, Paul Heroult (1863-1914), a
French chemist, working independently, produced aluminum bythe
same method. Inthehistory ofchemistry there aremany instances
ofthisduplication ofdiscovery where men, studying miles apart,
make thesame discovery within ashort time ofeach other. Tothe
first discoverer goes the credit. The others, nolessdeserving of
recognition, merely become losers intherace.
The difficulty which Hallencountered inproducing aluminum came
from thefactthat thismetal, high intheactivity series, could notbe
292
ALUMINUM 293
reduced byanyofthecommon reducing agents such ascarbon. To
overcome this difficulty Hall introduced theuseofelectric current
andturned toelectrolysis ashismethod ofmetallurgy. Itisbecause
ofthiselectrochemical metallurgical process thatCanada isplaying
anever-increasing role inthemetallurgy ofaluminum.
Intheyear1900theSt.Maurice River inQuebec was firstharnessed
forhydro-electric power andanaluminum plantwasbuilt atShawini-
gan Falls. In1925 themodel city ofArvida was built around the
Shipshaw aluminum plant ontheSaguenay River. Athirdaluminum
plant isnow located near theBeauharnois power installation onthe
St.Lawrence River.
The latest development intheproduction ofaluminum inCanada is
atKitimat inBritish Columbia. Some 400miles north ofVancouver

theNechako River hasbeendammed toprovide ahuge reservoir 150
miles long. This reservoir supplies water foratwomillion horsepower

ten-mile tunnel cutthrough solid rock. The station itself isbuilt
inside themountain. Afifty-mile transmission linedelivers thepower
tothesmelter atKitimat. When theproject isfinally infulloperation,
itwillproduce about 500,000 tons ofaluminum peryear, anamount
greater than thepresent total production ofalloftheCanadian plants.

Kitimat isthenewest development, buteven asengineers finish this
project, areas asfarnorth astheYukon arebeing surveyed aspossible
sites fornewaluminum plants.
Metallurgy ofaluminum. The ore,bauxite (A1 203-xH 20),named
forthevillage ofBaux inSouthern France, oneofthe firstsources of
aluminum ore, isareddish-brown clayfound inmany different parts
oftheworld. However, most ofthecommercial grades ofbauxite are
mined inareas inornearthetropics. Jamaica andBritish Guiana are
thesources ofpractically allofthebauxite used inCanada.
Bauxite hasaveryhighmelting point, andoneoftheproblems that
very nearly bested Hallwasthedifficulty inreleasing aluminum from
itsoxide. Byexperiment Halldiscovered thatbauxite would dissolve
incryolite (Na 3AlF 6),adouble fluoride ofsodium andaluminum
(3NaF-A1F3).Cryolite ismined inGreenland and ismade syn-
thetically. Itcontinues tobeusedtoday asthesolvent forbauxite.
Inorder tolower themelting point oftheelectrolyte still further,
fluorspar (CaF 2)fromNewfoundland isadded tothecryolite.
Bauxite must bepurified before itcanbeused intheelectrolytic cell.
Tobring about thepurification, thebauxite isdissolved inconcen-
trated sodium hydroxide solution. Theresulting solution isfiltered and
when diluted withwater purealuminum hydroxide precipitates, which

The electrical circuit isclosed bylowering thecarbon anode tothe
cathode lining andthen raising theanode. Thepowerful arcwhich is
struck produces sufficient heat (1000°C.) tokeep the electrolyte
molten. The reaction atthecathode mayberepresented bythe

Oxygen liberated attheanode unites with thecarbon forming
carbon monoxide which inturnmayburn toform carbon dioxide.

2COT02—^2C0 2
Hall’s electrolytic process iscontinuous. Alumina must beadded
from time totimeandthecarbon blocks oftheanode replaced as
needed. The cryolite andthefluorspar, however, arenotconsumed.
Because thealumina which isplaced inthecell isalmost 100% pure,
aluminum metal which isbetter that99% pure isproduced bythe
process.
Physical properties. Aluminum isoneofthelightest ofthecom-
monmetals (sp.gr.2*7)and issilvery white incolour. Aluminum is
malleable and ductile andcanbecast, rolled, forged, extruded and
drawn. Itisagood conductor ofheatandofelectricity. Thepure
element melts at660°C., and boils at1800°C.
Chemical properties. Aluminum isafairly active metal, asshown
byitsposition intheactivity series (p.283).Afreshaluminum
surface becomes coated with avery thinoxide film. However, this
oxide film effectively prevents further oxidation byoxygen inthe air.
Thus, aluminum metal andmany ofitsalloys canbeusedwithout
theprogressive deterioration thatoccurs with iron.
USESOFALUMINUM

ductivity oneofthe firstuses ofaluminum was inthemanufacture of

because ofitslightness andhigh electrical conductivity. Agreat
portion ofthecostofpower lines isintheconstruction ofthesupport-

cables made fromaluminum require fewer towers forsupport, and
costs aregreatly reduced. Thealuminum conducting cables aremade

therefore thataluminum may actchemically both asametal andas
anon-metal (Appendix E).

ofaluminum hydroxide.

Ironhasbeen serving man forthepast5000 years. Ironimplements
which dateback tothistimehavebeenfound inEgypt. Nodoubt
theearly metallurgy ofironresulted from thechance building ofhuge
campfires onoutcroppings ofthe ore,andtheironproduced was
undoubtedly ofverypoor quality. Because ofthework ofthescientist,
however, improvements have beenmade inmetallurgical processes
until to-day steel, analloy ofiron, iswithout doubt theworld’s most
important metal-like substance.
Theores ofiron. Iron isseldom found inthefreecondition. While
meteorites arepractically pure ironmixed withsome nickel, they are
sorarethatthey areconsidered asscientific curiosities rather than as
sources ofiron. Ores ofironwhich arefound intheform ofoxides are
hematite (Fe 203),magnetite (Fe 304),andlimonite (2Fe203-3H20).
Another oreknown assiderite occurs asthecarbonate (FeC03).
Deposits ofironoresarewidely distributed ontheearth. France,
Germany andRussia allhave extensive deposits oftheoxides, and
Great Britain produces considerable quantities ofsiderite. The
Mesabi Range, southwest ofLake Superior, supplies avastamount of
hematite fortheUnited States. Recently Venezuela hasbecome an
important exporter ofiron ore.
Although asmallamount ofironorehasbeen produced inNew-
foundland, Canada’s steel industry hasbeen largely dependent for
many years upon iron oreimported from theUnited States. The
necessity ofimporting hematite from theUnited States arose from the
factthat until recently Canada had littleknowledge ofherrich re-
sources ofiron ores. In1890Dr.W.H.C.Smith, ageologist, reported
adeposit ofhigh-grade ironorealong thesouth shore ofSteep Rock
Lake, approximately 150miles west ofPort Arthur, Ontario. An
attempt wasmade tomine theore,buttheinaccessibility oftheregion
caused theoperation tobeabandoned in1903.

In1937, Julian Cross, amining engineer, using adiamond drill
(seepages 165-7) andworking through theiceinwinter, prospected the
bottom ofSteep Rock Lake. Hisfindings indicated alargebody of
oreofveryhigh grade. Before itcould bemined, however, thecourse
ofariverhadtobediverted, theinlet tothelakehadtobedammed,
andthelake itselfhadtobedrained.
To-day three open-pit mines arelocated sidebysideonwhatwas
once thebottom ofthelake,andunderground work hasalready been
started. Inthe first three years ofoperation 3,000,000 tons ofore
have beenremoved and reserves ofhematite that arepossibly in
excess ofone billion tonshave been discovered.
Asearly as1894, A.P.Low, agovernment geologist, told ofgreat
deposits ofironoreintheUngava region ofnorthern Quebec andLab-
rador. Because ofinaccessibility andother difficulties therewas little or
noattempt made todevelop thedeposits atthat time. Theadvent of
IRONANDSTEEL 305
WorldWar II,however, brought with itgreatly increased demands for
more ironand steel. The steelindustry feltthattheMesabi Range was
insufficient andevenshowed signs ofrunning out.Bytheearly
1940’s interest intheUngava project wasrevived andplans were
laidtoovercome thedifficulties involved inbuilding railroads, develop-
ingpower sites, tunnelling through mountains andbuilding bridges
overdeepchasms. Theplanners realized that atleast $200,000,000.00
would berequired fortheproject, butthey also realized that the
inexhaustible supply ofironoreinthisareawould eventually more
thanrepay theinitial costandwould makeCanada oneoftherichest
sources ofiron intheworld.
Metallurgy ofiron. Almost invariably iron ore (hematite) is
reduced tothemetal inablast furnace. Carbon intheform ofcoke
burns tocarbon monoxide which acts asthereducing agent. The
blast furnace issometimes called asmelting furnace because themetal
isobtained from theoresbyaprocess ofmelting orfusion.
Theblast furnace. Theblast furnace isacylindrical structure 80to
125feethigh, constructed ofsteel plates andlined with athick layer
ofsome refractory material (silica ormagnesia). Thecharge consist-
ingofhematite ore,limestone andcoke isintroduced through ahopper
atthetopofthefurnace, andthemolten iron iswithdrawn from the
crucible atthebottom ofthefurnace. Theproduction ofeach ton
ofiron requires 1•5tons ofhematite ore, 1tonofcoke, 0•5tonof
limestone, andnearly 4tons ofair.

Asthecharge descends further itenters thezone offusion where the
mixture becomes apasty mass. Still lower inthestack, where the
temperature ishigher, theironandtheslagbecome liquids. Inthis

ironabsorbs silicon from theslagandcarbon from thecoke. Both
theironandtheslagareinamolten stateanddrop tothehearth where
the slag, lessdense than themolten iron, floats ontopoftheiron.
About every four orfivehours theslag istapped offthrough the
cinder notch. The iron isdrawn offthrough thetapping holewhich
remains sealed withafire-clay plug until theiron isready toberemoved.
From thisdescription oftheoperation ofthefurnace itisobvious
thatonce afurnace hasbeen fired theoperation iscontinuous aslong
astherefractory firebrick lining remains intact. Themodern blast
furnace iscapable ofproducing 500to1000 tons ofironduring each
24-hour period.
Iftheiron istobeprocessed further, itispoured intohot-metal cars
which haveacapacity of40to160tons. These carsaresoconstructed
thattheycandeliver theiron inamolten state tothesteel mills for
further treatment. Upon arrival atthemillthemolten iron isemptied
intoamixer inpreparation forthenext process.
Themolten ironmaybecastinto steelmolds andallowed toharden.
Themasses ofhardened ironfrom thesemolds areknown aspigs,and
theironfrom theblast furnace isknown aspig-iron. Pig-iron isquite
impure and isused tomake either cast iron,wrought iron orsteel
butthegreat bulk isused forthemanufacture ofsteel. Pig-iron
contains from 3\%to4^% ofcarbon which makes ithardand brittle.
Other impurities present inpig-iron arecompounds ofphosphorus,
sulphur, silicon andmanganese. The presence ofsulphur makes
iron brittle when itishot,whereas phosphorus makes itbrittle when
itiscold.
Castiron isproduced byheating molten pig-iron withscrap ironwhich
removes some oftheimpurities present inthepig-iron. Wrought iron
isobtained byremoving most oftheimpurities from pig-iron byheat-
ing inaspecially-constructed furnace known asareverberatory
furnace. Wrought iron isrelatively softbut istough andcanbe
readily welded. Itisuseful inmaking articles such aschains, anchors
and bolts, which must withstand sudden stresses.
Theblast furnace isoneofthemost efficient chemical plants known.
Theironproduced initcanbeused infoundries orasastarting point

cement andinsulating materials. Blast furnace gases arepiped tothe
stoves which preheat more airfortheprocess.
308 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
Themaking ofsteel. Steel isanalloy ofironcontaining lessthan
1-5%carbon. Analloy isamixture orasolid solution composed ofa
metal andoneormore other elements mixed inthemolten state to
produce asubstance having metal-like characteristics. Steelmaybe
made either bytheBessemer process, theopen-hearth process, orby
theelectric furnace method.
TheBessemer process. Prior to1856 themaking ofsteel from
pig-iron wasaslowandexpensive process. The steelproduced was
notalways uniform and therefore notsuitable forthepurpose for
which itwasintended, with theresult that thealloywasused in
limited quantities. Bessemer inEngland andKelly intheUnited
States, working independently, developed aprocess in1856 that
revolutionized thesteel industry. This process isknown to-day asthe
Bessemer process.
The basic reason forthesuccess oftheBessemer process isthat
silicon, manganese andcarbon, atthetemperature ofmolten iron,
1535°C., willburnwhen exposed toablast ofair.Theheatgiven off
bytheoxidation ofthese impurities issufficient toraise thetempera-
ture ofthecontents above themelting point ofiron. TheBessemer
process made itpossible forsteel tobeproduced cheaply enough for
general use.
TheBessemer process takes place inaBessemer converter (Fig. 29.4).
Theconverter isapear-shaped vessel made ofheavy steel plates and
lined with heat-resistant bricks which areusually made from silica
(Si0 2)anacidic anhydride, and fireclay.Theconverter ismounted on
ahorizontal axlewhich permits easy tilting forfilling, andthebottom
isfullofholes through which compressed airisblown, immediately after
thecharge hasbeenadded. Theaverage converter hasacapacity offrom
15to25tonsand issoconstructed thatacharge ofmolten pig-iron may
bebrought from the“mixer” andpoured directly into itwhile the
converter isheld inahorizontal position. The blast ofair isthen
turned onwithanairpressure of22to28pounds persquare inch,and
thevessel isgradually raised toavertical position.
The reaction with the airblast isimmediate and violent. The
silicon impurities oxidize andtogether withsome ferrous oxide that
hasbeenformed bytheoxidation ofsome oftheironproduce aslagof
ferrous silicate (FeSiCU). During this period (approximately 5
minutes fora25-ton charge) ayellow flame comes from themouth of
theconverter.
Bythetime thesilicon impurities havebeenburned out,thecarbon
starts tooxidize. Thiscombustion produces great volumes ofgases
which come from themouth oftheconverter with agreat roarand

forthevessel tobe

talposition again.
The slagwhich is
floating ontopof
the molten iron
runs offfirst, leaving practically pure ironwhich ispoured into ladles.
This molten ironhasalowpercentage ofcarbon andcontains dis-
solved gases.Toproduce steel ofknown composition adefinite amount
ofanalloy ofpredetermined composition isadded tothemolten
metal inthe ladle. Ifsmall amounts ofmanganese arerequired,

to5%carbon, isused. Ifthe steel requires ahigh percentage of
manganese, thealloy ferromanganese, which contains 78to82%
manganese and6to7%carbon, isused.
Usesandlimitations ofBessemer steel. Thechief uses ofBessemer
steel include themaking ofsheet steel, pipes, bars,and rails. Because
thistype ofsteelcontains some sulphur itcutswithout “balling” under
theblade ofacutting tool.
Only asmall percentage ofthesteelproduced to-day comes from the
Bessemer process. Bessemer steel isnot flexible enough tobe
entirely satisfactory forconstruction purposes. Furthermore, much
ofourironorecontains compounds ofphosphorus andasthese and
other acid-acting impurities arenotremoved bytheBessemer process,
thequality ofBessemer steel issomewhat inferior tosteelproduced by
theopen-hearth process.
Theopen-hearth process. Ninety percent ofallthesteel used to-
day isproduced intheopen-hearth furnace. Thefurnace itself isa
large, completely enclosed rectangular brick structure (Fig. 29.5). The
name “open-hearth” isusedbecause theshallow, basin-like floor ofthe
furnace, where thecharge isplaced, isexposed totheflames produced
bytheburning ofnatural ormanufactured gas, oil,orofacombination
ofgasand oil.Topromote complete combustion ofthe fuel, air is
introduced under pressure. The fuelandtheairareboth preheated,
andtheoperating temperature reached bythefurnace isclose to
1700°C. Asthematerials placed intheopen-hearth furnace are
usually acidic because they contain phosphorus, thelining ofthe
furnace ismade upofbricks ofmagnesia (MgO) andoflime(CaO).
Thecharge iscontrolled bythemelter who isresponsible forthe
furnace. Each charge varies, depending upon thetype ofsteel re-
quired, but itusually contains varying amounts ofmolten pig-iron,
amixture ofironoreandrusty scrap steel, andlimestone, which acts
astheflux inslagformation.
Undesirable substances inthepig-iron usually include carbon,
silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. These areremoved during the
process asindicated bythefollowing reactions:
(i)Thecarbon isburned outbytheoxygen oftheairandbythe
action oftheiron oxide.
2C+02— 2CO
Fe203+3C— >-3CO+2Fe
(ii)Calcium oxide formed bytheheating ofthelimestone flux

Ironsulphide reacts with theferrous oxide thathasbeenformed by
oxidation oftheironandproduces sulphur dioxide which escapes asa
gas.
FeS+2FeO—*3Fe+S0 2
Thehotproducts ofthecombustion ofthese impurities, along with
thegases resulting from thecombustion ofthe fuel, escape through
ports atoneend ofthefurnace, andpassthrough acheckerboard of
bricks called regenerators. When theheat hasbeen removed, the
gases arethenvented totheatmosphere through astack. While the
regenerators attheexitport arebeing heated bytheexhaust gases,
those attheentrance aregiving upheat tothefuelwhich isbeing
preheated. The flow ofthemixture offueland air isreversed at
approximately twenty-minute intervals, and inthisway theprocess
utilizes heat thatwould otherwise bewasted andassures aconstant
supply ofheat topreheat themixture ofairand fuel. The direction
offlow iscontrolled bythevalves ViandV2asshown inthediagram
ofthefurnace, Fig. 29.5.
Thetime required toprocess 100tons ofsteel averages 11^hours.
Asthe“heat” nears thecompletion time, samples aretaken frequently

heated inthebrickwork checker chambers. Thehearth ofthefurnace isopen to
flames which melt thecharge.

andquickly analysed. Iftheanalysis shows thatachange incom-
position ofthesteel isrequired, suitable additions aremade tothe
heat.
When themelter issatisfied thatthesteel isofthecorrect composition
andthat theprocess iscomplete, thefurnace istapped. The slag,
which now carries theimpurities, islessdense than the steeland
floats onthesurface fromwhich itisskimmed off. Either spiegeleisen
orferromanganese isadded andthesteel isteemed (poured) intoingot
molds.
Uses ofopen-hearth steel. Open-hearth steel isused for rails,
machinery, structural work, and ship-building.
The electric furnace. Electric furnace steel isobtained by
refining steelwhich hasbeen produced bytheBessemer andopen-
hearth furnaces ineither electric arcorelectric induction furnaces. In
thearcfurnace themolten steelcontained inalarge crucible isheated
byacurrent ofelectricity flowing through thesteelbetween carbon
electrodes. Intheinduction furnace theheat isgenerated within the
molten metal byplacing thecrucible inside acoilthrough which an
alternating current ofhighfrequency ispassed. Electric furnace steel
isused fortheproduction ofhigh-grade products and specialized
alloys. Thecapacity ofeach electric furnace isapproximately 500
pounds. The steelcontained intheingots isprocessed inavariety of
ways, depending upon theuses towhich thesteel willbeput.
Rolling. Steel isrelatively plastic at875°C. andmayberolled into
thin sheets atthistemperature. Itisimportant that therolling be

carried outgradually sothat thesteel willnotrupture externally or
internally. Toaccomplish thisgradual change inthickness, the
metal makes aseries ofpasses through thevarious rollers ofthemill.
Since thecorrect temperature must bemaintained, theingot molds
aretransferred toa“soaking pit”where they arebrought toatemper-
ature of1300°C. Bythus raising thetemperature, sufficient heat is
assured forthecomplete rolling process.
Tempering. When steel isheated toaspecific high temperature,
quenched (cooled quickly), reheated toaspecific temperature, and
thencooled under control, thesteel issaidtobetempered. Ifhotsteel
iscooled slowly, itbecomes softandtough, but ifitisquenched with
coldwater, itwillbehardand brittle. Thetoughness andthehard-
ness ofthesteelcanbecontrolled bycareful regulation ofthistemper-
ingprocess.
Case-hardening. Soft, tough steelmaybecarburized, orcase-
hardened, byheating itincontact with charcoal. Thecarburizing
forms anoutside layer ofsteelwhich contains ahigh percentage of
carbon. Accordingly theoutside ofacarburized object ishard while
thecentre remains softandtough. Asimilar resultmaybeobtained
byaprocess known asnitriding, where thesteel isheated inanatmos-
phere ofammonia.
Alloy steels. Alloy steels areproduced when other elements in
addition tocarbon areadded tothemolten steel. Alloy steels have
many desirable properties notfound inordinary steelandbecause of
these properties have amultiplicity ofuses.

Uses ofsteel. Railroads areamong thegreatest users ofsteelboth
forrailsandequipment. Steel isalsoused ingreat amounts forthe
building ofships, bridges, automobiles, and themanufacture of
hardware. Theframework oflarge buildings isusually made of
steel.Thepetroleum industry andthemining industry make extensive
useofthevarious alloy steels.
Much steel isused asthebasic form forthemanufacture ofstamped
goods. The so-called “tincan” ismade ofsoft steel covered with a
thin plating oftin.
Physical properties ofiron. Pure iron isnotmade onacommercial

Chemical properties ofiron. Themost important reaction ofiron
istheaction thattakes placewhen iron rusts. Rusting isacomplex
process requiring thepresence ofbothoxygen andmoisture. Iron
doesnotrust indryairbut itdoes rust inthepresence ofoxygen and
water. Thereaction mayberepresented asfollows:
4Fe-p3O2T3H2O—^2Fe203*3H2O
IRONANDSTEEL 315
The film ofrust isquite porous anddoes notadhere closely tothe
surface ofthemetal asdotheoxides ofaluminum andcopper. Hence
itdoes notprotect theironfrom further rusting. The corrosion of
iron constitutes avery serious problem inindustry and results in
heavy financial loss.Some ofthemethods ofreducing thecorrosion
ofiron are:
1.Coating theironwith other metals (e.g.galvanized ironhasa
coating ofzinc).
2.Adding corrosion inhibitors tofluids incontact with iron (e.g.
anti-freeze additives toreduce radiator corrosion).
3.Alloying with other metals (stainless steel isanalloy ofironand
chromium—seechart ofalloys, p.314).
4.Covering thesurface with paint.
Iron issufficiently high intheactivity series that itreacts with
steam toproduce hydrogen andmagnetic ironoxide (Fe304),known
alsoasferrous-ferric oxide (Fe0-Fe203).

Fe+2HC1—FeCl2+H2

However, ifconcentrated nitric acid isused, themetal becomes
passive, i.e.anadherent oxide filmforms which prevents further
action. This passivity isdestroyed ifthesurface oftheiron is
scratched.
Compounds ofiron. Iron isinGroup VIII ofthePeriodic Table.
Like theother elements inthisgroup, ithasvariable valence and
coloured compounds.
Ironforms two series ofcompounds—theferrous (Fe++
)andthe
ferric (Fe+++).Ferrous compounds areusually palegreen incolour.
Most ofthem areeasily oxidized byatmospheric oxygen toferric
compounds. Ferric compounds areusually reddish-brown incolour.
Ferrous hydroxide [Fe(OH) 2].Themixing ofaferrous saltwithabase
produces apalegreen precipitate offerrous hydroxide which quickly
changes through various shades ofgreen toamuddy green colour.

Ferrous oxide (FeO), prepared bypartial reduction offerric oxide
withhydrogen, isablack powder. Itspontaneously returns toferric

Ferrous sulphide (FeS) isformed byheating amixture ofironand
sulphur.
Fe+S—>-FeS
Pyrite (FeS 2)isanaturally-occurring sulphide ofironwhich because
ofitsyellow colour isalso called fool’s gold.
Ferrous sulphate (FeS0 4)isprobably themost important ferrous
salt,andthegreen hydrate FeS0 4•7H20isitscommonest form. If
equal molecular amounts offerrous sulphate andammonium sulphate
aremixed inwater andallowed tocrystallize (byevaporating some of
thewater and cooling), adouble salt, ferrous ammonium sulphate
[FeS0 4•(NH 4)2S04•6H20] isformed. Either this salt orferrous
sulphate canbeused inthebrown-ring testforthenitrate ion(p.225).
Theformula ofthedarkbrown compound formed inthebrown-ring
test isFe(NO) -S0 4(ferrous nitrosyl sulphate—acomplex compound of
nitric oxide and ferrous sulphate). Ferrous sulphate isused asa
mordant indyeing and inmaking ink.Amixture oftannic acid (a
complex organic acidobtained from nut-galls) and ferrous sulphate
solution gives acolourless solution offerrous tannate. Airoxidizes
theferrous tannate toinsoluble black ferric tannate.
Ferric oxide (Fe 203)isprepared byheating either ferric hydroxide
orferrous sulphate toahightemperature. Theoxide prepared bythe
heating offerrous sulphate isaredpowder. Itisused asapolishing
powder (rouge) andasapigment incosmetics (Venetian red). Ferric
oxide isinsoluble inwater and isonlymoderately soluble inacids.
Ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH) 3]forms asareddish-brown precipitate
when abase isadded toasolution ofaferric salt.
FeCl3+3NH4OH—Fe(OH)3+3NH4C1
Ferric hydroxide isaveryweak baseand isnotsoluble inanexcess
ofastrongly basic solution such assodium hydroxide. This action
isincontrast with theaction ofaluminum hydroxide withsodium
hydroxide solution (p.300).
Ferric chloride (FeCl3)and ferric sulphate [Fe 2(S0 4)3]areboth
soluble inwater. They aremoderately easily reduced toferrous salts
bysuchreducing agents asstannous chloride (SnCl 2),hydrogen witha
platinum catalyst, zincmetal, andother active metals.
IRONANDSTEEL 317
Ferric sulphate forms adouble saltwithammonium sulphate,
Fe2(S04)3•(NH 4)2SC>4•24H20,exactly analogous tocommon alum.
Infact, this salt iscalled ferric alum. More stable than thesimple
sulphate, ferric alum isoften used forpreparing solutions containing
theferric ion.
Cyanides ofiron. Ferrous and ferric ionsform aseries ofcomplex
cyanides which have important usesboth foridentifying ironand for
dyeing.
When potassium cyanide isadded tosolutions offerrous and ferric
salts, ferrous and ferric cyanides areproduced.
FeCl 2+2KCN— >-Fe(CN)2+2KC1
FeCl3+3KCN— >-Fe(CN)3+3KC1
When excess potassium cyanide isadded, thecomplex salts, yellow
potassium ferrocyanide andredpotassium ferricyanide areformed.
Fe(CN)2+4KCN—>K4Fe(CN)6
Fe(CN)3+3KCN—>K3Fe(CN)6
Both ofthesecompounds aresoluble inwater.
Thereactions offerrous and ferric ionswithpotassium ferrocyanide
andpotassium ferricyanide giveaseries offourcompounds ofwhich

added toasolution ofpotassium ferrocyanide, deep blue ferric ferro-
cyanide, called Prussian blue, isprecipitated.
4FeCl3+3K4Fe(CN)6— 3-Fe4[Fe(CN) 6]3+12KC1
Prussian blue isused aslaundry blueing andasink,and itsformation
isatestfortheferric ion.
Ferrous ferricyanide (Fe3[Fe(CN)6]2),formed when asolution ofa
ferrous salt isadded topotassium ferricyanide, isadarkblueprecipitate

Copper
Who isablewith powerful genius toframe apoem worthy ofthe
grandeur ofthethings andthese discoveries?
Lucretius
Copper hasbeenknown formore than6000 yearsandwasoneofthe
firstmetals tobeusedbyman. Itisbelieved that intheearly ages it
wasmined inthefreestate, mixed with tin. Inthefirstcrude attempts
torefine copper, itislikely thatanalloywasproduced rather than
purecopper yetEgyptian statuettes made ofpurecopper have been
found which date back to2500 B.C. Archaeological discoveries
indicate that inearly times copper wasused chiefly forornaments,
cooking utensils andweapons.
Canada asaproducer ofcopper. Canada isproducing more than
250,000 tons ofcopper ayearfromCanadian oresandapproximately
fiftypercent ofthiscomes from thenickel-copper mines nearSudbury.
Approximately twenty-six percent ismined inQuebec, andsixteen per
cent ofthecountry’s output ismined inManitoba andSaskatchewan.
Important operations arecentred intheFlinFlon district aswellasat
Lynn Lake. Concentrates from these mines aretaken tothenew

COPPER 321
Atpresent eight percent ofCanada’s copper comes from British
Columbia, and recent surveys inthePortland Canal area have
disclosed large deposits ofcopper hitherto untapped.
Although free(native) copper hasbeenfound intheLake Superior
region inCanada, thesulphide oresremain themostimportant sources
from which weobtain themetal. Thetwomost important copper
ores arechalcocite (Cu 2S)and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2).Insome

while itmay differ slightly from onerefinery toanother, isinbroad

Concentration. Low grade ores(-7% to5%copper) arecon-
centrated bythefroth-flotation process (p.290)andthenpassed onto
theroasters. Itisnotnecessary topass highgrade oresthrough a
flotation tank.
Roasting. Theconcentrate isplaced inlarge furnaces where itis
heated inthepresence ofair. Ironimpurities unite withoxygen from
theairandform ferrous oxide (FeO). Thecopper isconverted into
cuprous sulphide (Cu 2S).The resulting sulphur dioxide isvented to
theatmosphere orcollected andconverted intosulphuric acid (p.205).

Inaddition tothecuprous sulphide andtheferrous oxide, theore

were originally present. Themixture ofsubstances resulting from the
roasting furnace iscalled calcine.

leaving Cu 2Sandsome FeS,with themetallic impurities, intheform
known asmatte copper.

The converter. Theconverter, sometimes described asamodified
Bessemer, islined with silica (Si0 2).When air isblasted through the
converter, theremaining ferrous sulphide isoxidized toferrous oxide
which reacts with the silica lining toform slag. Part oftheCu 2Sis
converted intoCu 20,andtheremaining Cu 2Sreacts with theCu20
toproduce freecopper andsulphur dioxide gas.

Anyremaining ferrous oxide isremoved byadding aweighed amount
ofSi0 2which actsasafluxandforms aslag. Themolten copper from
theconverter contains many bubbles ofsulphur dioxide and isknown
asblister copper.
Theanode furnace. Themolten blister copper isputdirectly into
ananode furnace where air ispassed through topurify itfurther.
This process oxidizes some ofthecopper andany residual iron or

Uses ofcopper. Copper isprobably second only toiron inimport-
ance. Thefollowing represent only afewofthemany uses ofcopper.
Intheelectrical field. Atleast 50percent ofthecopper produced
to-day isusedbythedifferent electrical industries. These industries
manufacture wire forthe electric circuits inmotors, fortelegraph
circuits, fortelephone wires, forradio and television senders and
receivers, foreveryday appliances such astoasters, irons, etc.
Intheconstruction andbuilding trades. When exposed tomoist air
copper forms abasic copper carbonate [Cu(OH) 2•CuCOs], sometimes
called patina. This patina forms aprotective coating, which makes
copper useful foreave troughing, flashing, etc. Heating units and
plumbing installations alsouseconsiderable amounts ofcopper.
Intheprocessing industries. Ascopper isonly slightly attacked
bydilute acids (p.326), itisused incontainers andpipes where such

Physical properties. Themost important property ofcopper isits
ability toconduct electricity. Itisaheavy metal with adensity of
8-9gm.per cc. Itismalleable and ductile. Pure copper when
heated canbedrawn intoafinewireand itcanalsobeshaped with
ease. Ifcopper ishammered, itbecomes hard. Copper melts at
1083°C. and boils at2300°C.
Chemical properties. Copper isbelow hydrogen intheactivity
series
;inother words, itisarelatively inactive element. Because ofits
relative inactivity itisfound intheelemental, ornative state innature.
Copper slowly tarnishes inmoist air.Eventually acoating ofthe
basic carbonate ofcopper isformed which gives thecharacteristic
green colour tocopper roofs inmoist climates.
Copper willnotreact with acids toproduce hydrogen andcon-
sequently appears below hydrogen intheactivity series (p.283).
Copper isattacked, however, byoxidizing acids. Forexample, either
cold, dilute orconcentrated nitric acids will react with copper to
produce water andoxides ofnitrogen.

Organic Chemistry
Many compounds nowreferred toasorganic musthave existed onearth
before lifebegan, butonly invery recent times hasmuch progress been
made intheir study.
CarlNoller
One oftheprincipal branches ofchemistry iscentred around a
study ofthecompounds ofthesingle element carbon. Asthenumber
oforganic compounds isapproximately twenty times greater than the
total ofinorganic compounds, theformation ofaseparate branch of
chemistry isnecessary.
Organic compounds. Thename organic chemistry hasbeen given
tothestudy ofthecompounds ofcarbon because intheearly days of
chemistry most oftheknown carbon-containing compounds were
associated with living matter. Upuntil 1828, scientists believed that
thecompounds produced byliving processes could notbesynthesized
outside aliving body. Inthat year Wohler synthesized urea
[(NH 2)2CO], acompound found inurine, bytheinteraction oftwo
inorganic salts,ammonium sulphate andpotassium cyanate. Am-
monium cyanate (NH 4CNO), one oftheproducts ofthis reaction,

living matter. The principal reasons thatcarbon isable toform so
many compounds are (1)carbon hastherelatively high valence of
fourand (2)carbon atoms joineach other toform chains orrings
(Fig. 31.1). The ability ofcarbon atoms tolinktogether toform
chains orrings isacharacteristic ofthelighter elements inGroup IV
ofthePeriodic Table (p.238)and ismostemphasized incarbon. When
thecarbon atoms combine with each other theydosobyforming a
covalent linkage.
Covalence. Covalence isthetype ofbonding orjoining together
ofatoms which occurs inmolecules ofallacidsand ingases such as
Ha,N2,02,Cl2,andH20,C0 2,NH3,S0 2,NO, HC1, etc.When
covalent compounds aredissolved inwater theydonotseparate into
ions;theymay either gointosolution inaphysical sense ortheymay
react with thewater inachemical sense producing hydronium ions,
H30+(hydrated hydrogen ions).

This action withwater isincontrast totheaction with bases and
salts which contain electrovalent bonds (p.137)andwhich dodis-
sociate into ionswhen dissolved inwater.
The term molecule iscustomarily used onlywhen referring to
covalent compounds. Electrovalent compounds, held together as
they arebyelectrostatic attraction, cannot claim this distinctive
name. Many compounds contain both covalent and electrovalent
bonds.
Onpage 131,valence bonds were represented by“arms” grasping
each other between theadjoining atoms. Inwriting formulae, how-
ever, itiscustomary touselines instead of“arms”, andthesymbols
arelinked together directly bythelinesandarenotenclosed incircles.

The explanation ofcovalence. Chapter 13indicates that inthe
case ofelectro valence, theatoms transfer electrons byborrowing or
lending them inorder toacquire thestable octet structure asfound in
thenearest inert gas. Inthecase ofcovalence, theatoms share pairs
ofelectrons (usually onefrom eachatom) inorder toacquire thesame
number asinthenearest inert gas. Thus, inhydrogen (H2)each
hydrogen atom shares itselectron with theother sothat ashared
pair ofelectrons resides between thetwoatoms (Fig. 31.3). Each
hydrogen atomnowshares thesamenumber ofelectrons asthestable
helium atom. Similarly inchlorine (Cl2)theoutside ring ofeach
chlorine atom shares oneofitselectrons with theoutside ring ofthe
otheratom sothateachatom holds (orshares in)thesamenumber of
electrons asfound intheoutside ring ofthestable argon atom.

Fig. 31.3. Theelectronic structures ofthehydrogen (H2)andthechlorine (Cl2)
molecules. Each atom “shares” oneelectron with theother atom. Thetwo
“shared” electrons belong tobothatoms ofapair. Thetwo“shared" electrons con-
stitute asingle covalent bond.
Theexperimental difference between electrovalence andcovalence
isthattheelectrovalent bondcomes apart inawater solution while the
covalent bond does not.
Thesame valence rules apply both tocovalence and toelectro-
valence, andthecalculation ofthevalence ofeachelement inasimple
compound isthesame asgiven inChapter 13.However, adifficulty
arises when one tries tocalculate thevalences ofelements incom-
pounds inwhich theatoms ofthesame element arejoined toeach other.
Asthis isthecase formost organic compounds, othermethods must be
used. Theuseofstructural formulae asshown inFig.31.1overcomes
the difficulty. Single valence bonds indicate oneshared pair of
electrons andarerepresented inaformula byasingle line. Double
valence bonds indicate twoshared pairs ofelectrons andarerepre-
sented bytwo lines.
Carbon atoms combine with each other andwith other atoms by
covalent bonds. Carbon incarbon compounds exhibits avalence of

thetetravalence ofcarbon iscarbon monoxide (CO) anunsaturated
molecule that readily takes onanother oxygen atom tobecome carbon

Structural formulae show (1)therelative positions oftheatoms with
respect toeach other, asrepresented onaplane ofpaper orblackboard

Actually, thefourvalence bonds around eachcarbon atom inthese
compounds aredistributed equally inthree-dimensional space, and
each valence bond that isnotshared with acarbon isshared with a
hydrogen. When valence bonds areshared inthisway thecom-
pounds aresaid tobesaturated withhydrogen.
Many compounds exist, however, where there arenot sufficient
hydrogen atoms tosatisfy orsaturate allofthecarbon atoms. To
explain thetetravalent nature ofcarbon insuch cases, twocarbon

divided arehydrocarbons, alcohols andethers, aldehydes andketones,
acids, andesters. Bysubstituting anOHgroup forahydrogen atom
inthehydrocarbon methane (CH4), ahydroxyl derivative ofmethane
known asmethyl alcohol (CH3OH) isformed. Asoxygen hasbeen
added, methyl alcohol (CH4O) isconsidered tobeanoxidation

formaldehyde (CH 20).

Another method ofclassifying organic compounds depends upon
theway inwhich thecarbon atoms areheld together. Insomecom-
pounds thecarbon atoms arelinked together inlong chain-like struc-
tures. Such chain compounds areknown asaliphatic hydrocarbons.
Inother hydrocarbons thecarbon atoms arelinked together insucha
waythattheyform ringstructures. Such ringcompounds areknown
asaromatic hydrocarbons.

fore, thatcarbon compounds aresonumerous.
Hydrocarbons. Compounds composed only ofcarbon andhydrogen
areknown ashydrocarbons. Thesimplest hydrocarbons form aseries
ofsaturated compounds known astheparaffin series (methane series),
andthe firstandsimplest member oftheseries ismethane, CH 4.The
general formula oftheseries isCnH2n+2inwhich n=number ofcarbon

The paraffins constitute anhomologous series where each succeeding
member differs from theonebefore itbyCH 2.The lighter members,

liquids; andthose from Ci8toashigh asC100aresolids.

Isomerism. When valence rules areapplied inwriting theformulae
ofcarbon compounds, itbecomes evident that thesamenumber of
carbon andhydrogen atomsmayhave different arrangements ofthe
atoms within themolecule, producing compounds having different
properties.

Both ofthesecompounds have thesame percentage composition but
they differ considerably intheir physical andchemical properties. For
example, liquid n-butane boils at—0-6°C.,andiso-butane at—10°C.
Isomerism istheexistence oftwo ormore compounds with the
same percentage composition andmolecular weight but different
properties. Isomers have different arrangements oftheir atoms
within themolecules, asshown bytheir different structural formulae.
Thenumber ofisomers oftheparaffin series ofhydrocarbons alone
isenormous. There isonlyonepossible arrangement ofatoms for
each ofmethane, ethane andpropane. Two isomers arepossible for
butane, three arepossible forpentane; foroctane, however, there are
19,and foreicosane (C20H42)there areover 100,000.
Anti-knock gasoline. Animportant application ofisomerism is
found inthe oilrefining industry. Theproduction ofgasolines with
high “octane-ratings” (p.188) requires special catalysts toconvert
straight chain hydrocarbons (e.g.n-hexane) intobranch chain isomers
(e.g.aniso-hexane). Thestraight chaincompounds cause knocking in
theinternal combustion engine while theirbranch chain isomers donot.
Special tests arecarried outatprovincial government laboratories
tofindthe“octane-ratings” ofcommercial gasolines. Normal heptane
(C7H16),thestraight chain isomer ofheptane, hasmuch higher knock-
ingproperties than straight-run gasoline from therefinery and is
assigned anoctane rating ofzero.Ahighly branched isomer of
octane (CgHig), called iso-octane, hasmuch lower knocking properties
than untreated gasoline. Iso-octane isassigned anoctane rating of
100.Tofindthe“octane-rating” ofaparticular gasoline, theper-
formance ofthegasoline inastandard engine iscompared with the
performance ofvarious mixtures ofn-heptane(0)and iso-octane
(100). An“octane-rating” of80means that thegasoline performs
thesame asamixture of80parts ofiso-octane and20parts n-heptane.
InAlberta, the“octane-ratings” of“regular” and“premium” gaso-
lines areabout 77and79respectively.
The“octane-rating” ofgasoline israised byisomerization, that is,
byconverting straight chain hydrocarbons into their branch chain
342 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
isomers. Itisalso raised bytheaddition ofanti-knock compounds
such asleadtetraethyl [Pb(C2HB)4].
Highly branched hydrocarbons with “octane-ratings” greater than
100havebeenproduced, andthese areusedalong with leadtetraethyl
tomake gasoline blends foraviation fuel.
Other aliphatic hydrocarbons. The aliphatic hydrocarbons include
alarge variety ofcompounds, e.g.natural rubber andmany synthetic
rubbers, turpentine (Ci 0Hi6),andcarotene (C40H56 ,butter yellow)
which isasource ofvitamin A.
Aromatic hydrocarbons arecarbon-hydrogen compounds that con-
taincarbon atoms linked together inrings. Not allringcompounds
arearomatics, but allaromatics contain oneormore rings. The
structural difference between aromatic ringcompounds andother
ringcompounds isthataromatic compounds have alternate double
andsingle bonds between thecarbon atoms inthering. Forexample,

odour. Itisused inmoth balls.
Benzene derivatives arevery important compounds. They are
used inthemanufacture ofdyes, drugs, explosives, plastics, andmany
other substances.
Alcohols and ethers. The first step intheoxidation ofahydro-
carbon produces analcohol (p.336). Allalcohols contain oneormore
hydroxyl groups (—OH)butthey arenotbases (p.158). Inalcohols
the (—OH)group isattached directly toacarbon atom. Thenames
ofalcohols end in-ol.Forexample, CH3OH ismethyl alcohol, or
methanol.
Methyl alcohol (CH 3OH) issometimes called wood alcohol because
itcanbeobtained bythedestructive distillation ofwood. Itisvery
poisonous, and iftaken internally, maycause blindness anddeath. It
isused insome anti-freezes andasanindustrial solvent.
Ethyl alcohol (C2HBOH) isthemost important alcohol. Most of
itisobtained bytheyeast fermentation ofsugars. Although Pasteur
(1822-1895) discovered that yeast wasnecessary toconvert sugar to
alcohol, Buchner latershowed thatthejuice extracted from yeast cells
which hadbeen completely destroyed wascapable ofbringing about
fermentation. Theactive substance inthejuice isanenzyme called
zymase (Chaper 32).
The chief sources ofsugars forfermentation into alcohol arethe
various starches (corn, potato, rice)andsugar-cane molasses. Another
important method ofproducing ethyl alcohol isbysynthesis using
ethylene, sulphuric acidandwater.
Asharp rise intheuseofethyl alcohol during World War IIwas
duetoitsuseinthesynthesis ofbutadiene forthemanufacture of
synthetic rubber. Inrecent years, ethyl alcohol hasbeenused forthe
manufacture ofacetaldehyde andother chemicals, asanindustrial
solvent andasaradiator anti-freeze.
Alcohols withmore than onehydroxyl group include ethylene
glycol [C2H4(OH)2orCH 2OH-CH 2OH],animportant anti-freeze, and
glycerol [C3HB(OH) 3]alsopopularly known asglycerine.
Animportant aromatic alcohol isphenol (C6H5OH), which is
popularly called “carbolic acid”. Itisavery corrosive liquid which
when used inproper dilutions isaneffective disinfectant.

Organic acids. Organic acids areusually prepared bytheoxidation

acid(CH3COOH) arethe firsttwomembers ofaseries ofacidsknown

from animal fats. Allorganic acids contain thecarboxyl group,

Soaps areusually mixtures ofthesodium salts ofpalmitic and

CHAPTER 32
TheChemistry ofFoods
Butthere isapart oflifewhich canbegrasped bychemical means,
andthere arechemically defined substances which canchange the
course ofessential processes inliving organisms.
Eduard Farber,
Thefoodweeat isacomplex mixture oforganic compounds, in-
organic salts and water. The food undergoes changes which in
biochemistry areclassified asdigestion, absorption andmetabolism.
Digestion refers tothebreakdown offood intosimpler substances and
occurs inthealimentary canal. Absorption isthetransfer ofthe
digested food intotheblood stream. Metabolism refers tothechemical
changes thatoccur inthebody tissues after absorption ofthefood.The
chemical changes occurring inthese three processes areanimportant
part ofbiochemistry, thescience which linkschemistry with biology.
Inthischapter thechemical composition offoods andsome ofthe
chemical changes that these foods undergo during digestion willbe
considered.
Foods aredivided intothree broad groups: carbohydrates, fatsand
proteins. Fortheutilization offood, thebody requires vitamins,
water, andcertain inorganic saltsimportant fortheir mineral content
andsometimes referred toasminerals.
Carbohydrates. Ofthethree groups offoods thecarbohydrates
arethesimplest inchemical structure. Thecarbohydrates found in
foods usually consist ofsugars, starches and cellulose. Sugars such
asglucose, fructose andsucrose arefound inmany fruits andvege-
tables. Sugar beets (Fig32 .1)andsugar cane areimportant sources
ofsucrose (table sugar). Honey isamixture ofglucose, fructose and
sucrose. Starches arethestored form ofcarbohydrates inplants; for
example, inpotatoes, wheat and rice. Cellulose isthemain com-
ponent ofthewoody parts oftreesandplants (seepage 275 ).
The chemical structure ofcarbohydrates. Carbohydrates are
composed ofcarbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Thehydrogen and
oxygen areusually inthesame proportion asinwater, that is,two
atoms ofhydrogen foreach oxygen atom; forexample, CeHioCh,
C6H12O6, C12H22O11. For thisreason they arecalled carbohydrates

(carbon hydrates). Thename ismisleading because hydrogen and
oxygen donotexist asmolecules ofwater inthecarbohydrate molecule.
Instead, there isalargenumber ofhydroxyl (—OH) groups inthe
carbohydrates, andafewoxygen(=0)atoms aswell. Thus carbo-
hydrates arerelated toalcohols, aldehydes andketones (Chap. 31).
Monosaccharides. Twoimportant examples ofcarbohydrates are
thesugars glucose andfructose. These areexamples ofsimple sugars,
ormonosaccharides, andbecause eachhastheformula CeHi 206they
aretherefore isomers (p.341 ).Themonosaccharides form thebasic
units ofthemore complex carbohydrates.
Disaccharides. The disaccharides arecompounds resulting from
thecombination oftwomonosaccharides withalossofonemolecule of
water; forexample:
C6H12O6 TCeHioOe ^C12H22O11 TH2O
fructose +glucose— »-sucrose+water
Thetwomostcommon disaccharides aresucrose (aplant sugar) and
lactose (ananimal sugar). Inthedigestion ofsucrose theabove
reaction isreversed producing simple sugars. Lactose (milk sugar) is
adisaccharide containing glucose and galactose asitsconstituent
monosaccharides.
Fehling’s solution. Amethod ofdistinguishing between sucrose
andthemonosaccharides, fructose andglucose, isbymeans ofFehling’s
solution. Fehling’s solution isafresh mixture ofasolution ofcupric
sulphate with asolution ofsodium hydroxide and Rochelle salt
THECHEMISTRY OFFOODS 349
(sodium potassium tartrate). When Fehlmg ssolution isadded to
glucose orfructose andheated, aredprecipitate ofcuprous oxide
forms. Sucrose does notgive this precipitate.
Polysaccharides represent acontinuation oftheunion ofsimple
sugar units intoonegiant molecule having properties quite different
from theoriginal simple sugars. Starch and cellulose arecommon
examples ofpolysaccharides. Thepolysaccharides donotdissolve in
water although some ofthem, starch forexample, maybedispersed in
it.Starches havefrom 300to1200 glucose units intheir molecules.
During digestion thefundamental
starch unit istransformed by
hydrolysis into thesugar glucose.

Thebreakdown ofcomplex sub-
stances intosimpler substances by
theaction ofwater iscalled hy-
drolysis. Water byitself willnot
hydrolyze starch very rapidly, and
therefore acatalyst isnecessary to
increase thevelocity ofthereaction.
Inthedigestion offoods, thecata-
lysts arefluids secreted bysalivary,
gastric and intestinal glands and
areknown asenzymes (Fig. 32.2).
Intheindustrial production of
corn syrup bythehydrolysis of
corn starch, thecatalyst iseither

joined together inlong chains. Itisinsoluble inwater andcannot be
digested byhuman beings orother mammals. However, northern
caribou andreindeer have bacteria intheir digestive tracts which
hydrolyze cellulose into glucose.
Cellulose isavery important industrial raw material. Itisthe
basic material inpaper and inmany fabrics such ascotton, rayon and
celanese. Rayon andcelanese aresometimes called artificial silks,
butthey areneither artificial norarethey silk. Natural silk isa
protein. Most rayons aremade bytheviscose process (pp. 272-3).
However, approximately 20% oftherayons areproduced bythe cel-
lulose acetate process (celanese). InAlberta there isalarge cellulose
acetate plant justoutside ofEdmonton (Fig. 32.3). (See also Figs.
31.6and31.8 inprevious chapter.)
Fatsand oils. Another group oforganic compounds which serve
asfoods andbody components arethefatsand edible oils.The
difference between afatandanoilismerely thatafatisasolidandan
oilisaliquid atordinary temperatures. Simple fatsand oilscontain
carbon, hydrogen andoxygen, butsome fatsand oilsareofamore
complex nature andcontain nitrogen andphosphorus. Inthis text
thesimpler fatsand oilsonly willbeconsidered.
Fatsand oilsareinsoluble inwater, butsoluble inether, chloroform
and acetone.
Fatsand oilsareesters (substances produced bythereaction of
alcohols andacids) ofhigher fatty acidsandglycerol. Forexample,
stearin (Ci7H35COO)3C 3H5istheester ofstearic acid(C17H35COOH)
andglycerol [C3H5(OH) 3].

glyceryl stearate
Natural fatsand oilsarecomplex mixtures ofesters. Beef tallow
contains esters ofacids with 14,16,and18carbon atoms. Vegetable
oilsalsocontain smallamounts ofanester ofa20-carbon acid. Butter
contains thesame fatsascontained inbeeftallow and inaddition esters
ofbutyric (C4)andcaproic (Ce) acids. When butter goes rancid, the
characteristic odour produced isdue tothereleased butyric and
caproic acids.
Vegetable oils. These oilscontain amuch larger proportion of
unsaturated acid esters thandoanimal fats. That is,oneortwo
double bonds occur between some ofthecarbon atoms inthecarbon
chain oftheacid.Theaddition ofhydrogen tothese double bonds
converts them tosaturated acid esters. Thesaturation ofthedouble
bond raises themelting point ofthe oiluntil itbecomes afat.This
saturation byhydrogen, called hydrogenation, isaccomplished with

enzymes, lipase and steapsin.

These products, onentering theblood, areagain converted tofatsto

Proteins. Proteins arethemost complex ofthecomponents of
food. Proteins arepresent inallliving tissue. Certain tissues, such
asseeds and flesh, contain ahigher proportion ofproteins thando
fatty and structural tissues. The nitrogen cycle inChapter 24
illustrates theimportance ofproteins.
Proteins notonly feedmanbutalsohelp toclothe him. Meat,
cheese, andeggscontain proteins. Shoes andwool fabrics areproteins.
Natural silk isaprotein excreted bythesilkworm when itbuilds a
cocoon forthepupa stage initsmetamorphosis.
Four elements arepresent inallnatural proteins: carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, andnitrogen. Inaddition tothese elements many proteins
contain sulphur with smaller amounts ofother elements such as
phosphorus, iron,andiodine, which areessential constituents ofcertain
proteins. Thehaemoglobin ofblood contains iron. Most proteins
contain about53% carbon, 7%hydrogen, 23% oxygen and16%
nitrogen. Thenitrogen content ofproteins distinguishes them from
carbohydrates and fats.
Protein molecules arelarge insizeandcomplicated instructure.
Themolecular weights ofproteins range from 10,000 toseveral million.
Allproteins arebuilt from over 25different building blocks called
amino acids. Atpresent, chemists believe thatmany oftheamino
acids arejoined inchains within theprotein molecule.
Byapplying thepermutations andcombinations ofmathematics to
the25different amino acid building blocks, thegreat number of
different proteins thatcould existmaybeenvisioned. Thework of
unravelling thestructures ofmany oftheproteins isjustbeginning, and
agreat new field ofresearch isnowopen tophysical andorganic
chemists. Since proteins make uptheessential component ofliving

andchemists nowspeak of“themolecular weight ofavirus”. The
bushy stunt virus hasa“molecular weight” ofabout 10,000,000.
Thecomplete hydrolysis ofaprotein produces itsconstituent amino
acids.
Thesimplest amino acid isglycine, which hasthefollowing structural
formula:
H H O
\ IN—C—C
/ I\
H H O—H
Glycine hasastructure very similar toacetic acidwith thedifference
thatoneofthehydrogen atoms onthefirstcarbon next tothecarboxyl
group isreplaced byanamino (NH 2)group. Thus, glycine isalso
called amino acetic acid. Allamino acids have anamino group
attached tothecarbon next tothecarboxyl group.
Digestion ofproteins. Inthedigestion ofproteins, enzymes inthe
gastric andintestinal juices catalyze thehydrolysis oftheproteins to
amino acids.
Proteins +water—>amino acids
Theamino acids pass into theblood stream. Thus, along with
thehydrolyzed products ofcarbohydrates and fats, theamino acids
enter intometabolism.
Thexanthoproteic test forproteins consists ofthereaction ofa
protein with concentrated nitric acid (p.253). Theprotein turns to
ayellow-coloured substance, which isbelieved tobeanaddition of
nitric acid toparts oftheprotein molecule. Ifconcentrated nitric
acid isaccidentally dropped onskinorfingernails, theyellow xantho-
protein compound appears.
Proteins areextremely sensitive toheatand certain other forms
ofenergy. Above 65°C.many proteins undergo permanent changes
called denaturation. Anexample ofthispermanent change takes
place inthecooking ofanegg.Theeggwhite coagulates andcan
never bereturned toitsoriginal condition. Indenaturation thevery
complex arrangement oftheprotein molecules ispartly orwholly
destroyed. Another example ofdenaturation isthedangerous effect

ofultraviolet lightontheeyes. This light coagulates theprotein in
theeyesandcauses permanent damage. For this reason, welders
wear special goggles.
Vitamins. Vitamins areaccessory dietary compounds essential in
maintaining atanormal level themetabolic processes inanimals.
Until early inthe20thcentury anadequate dietwasbelieved to
consist ofsufficient carbohydrates, fats, proteins andinorganic salts.
Since thattimevitamins havebeen discovered andatpresent over 15
areknown. Their absence from thedietleads tovarious deficiency
diseases, buttheamounts ofvitamins required inanadequate dietare
very small compared with theamounts ofordinary foods. For
example, therecommended daily requirement ofvitamin Cis0-075
gram whereas that ofprotein is70grams.
The following arethesources and thesignificance ofthemore
important vitamins.
Vitamin Aisessential forgrowth andnormal vision. Anearly
deficiency sympton isnight blindness. Recent research hasshown
that night blindness isfairlycommon. The chief natural sources of
vitamin Aareleafygreen plants, fish-liver oils, eggs, butter, andcream.
Vitamin Bi(thiamin) isessential forthemaintenance ofgood
appetite and digestion. Deficiency ofBileads toretarded growth,
loss ofappetite, emotional instability, andadisease called beriberi.
The chief sources ofthisvitamin are liver, yeast, milk, eggs, fruits,
andlegumes.
Vitamin B2(riboflavin) isnecessary forthegrowth andrespiration
ofalltissues and cells. Deficiency symptoms arecracked andsore
lipsanddimness ofvision. Itisclosely related toBiand isfound in
many ofthesame foods.
Niacin (nicotinic acid) ispart ofthevitamin Bcomplex and is
required fornormal growth. The lack ofniacin produces pellagra, a
disease with extensive pigmentation onexposed parts oftheskin. Sore
andswollen tongue and loss ofappetite alsoaccompany pellagra.
Niacin isfound inthesame foods asBiandB2.
Vitamin C(ascorbic acid) isnecessary fortheformation andmain-
tenance oftooth andbone tissue. Thebestknown deficiency disease
isscurvy. Dental caries andslowhealing ofwounds arealsodeficiency
symptoms. Vitamin Coccurs incitrus fruits, cabbage, raw turnips,
andtomatoes.
Vitamin Dregulates thecalcification ofbone structure. Thelack
ofvitamin Dleads torickets (bowed legs, pigeon chest) andtooth
decay. Theimportant sources arefish-liver oils,mackerel, herring,
sardines, eggyolk,and liver.

Vitamin Kpromotes thenormal clotting ofblood. Vitamin K
deficiency leads topoor healing ofcutsandother wounds. Itisfound
inspinach, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot tops,andtomatoes.

Hormones. Hormones arecomplex organic compounds which are
thesecretions oftheendocrine orductless glands. Insulin, forex-
ample, isaprotein, andthyroxin isacomplex iodinated amino acid.
Hormones arereleased intobody fluids such astheblood stream, and
have specific effects onvarious organs andglands.
Adrenalin, forexample, the firsthormone tobesynthesized, is
excreted bytheadrenal glands which aresituated above thekidneys.
Adrenalin increases theblood pressure, accelerates theheart beatand

counteracts theeffect ofexcessive insulin. Hormones aresometimes
called chemical messengers because they regulate andcontrol thevari-
ousprocesses (growth, metabolic, reproductive) occurring inthebody.
Thehormone insulin isofparticular interest toCanadians. In
1922, Banting, Best, andMacleod, working attheUniversity of
Toronto, discovered insulin and forthisdiscovery were awarded
Canada’s onlyNobel prize. Insulin isexcreted bythepancreas and
regulates carbohydrate metabolism. Ifinsulin isnotproduced in
sufficient amounts bythepancreas, adisease known asdiabetes mellitus
develops.

Many disease conditions occurwhen thehormone secretions become
unbalanced. Chemists, bydiscovering thechemical structures of
most ofthehormones, have increased both ourknowledge andour
control ofmany living processes.
Chemotherapy. In1909, Paul Ehrlich synthesized theorganic
compound called salvarsan which wasfound tokilltheorganism
causing syphilis. Thus, Ehrlich, bysynthesizing chemical compounds
thataremore toxic fordisease organisms than forthehost,opened up
anew field ofchemistry. Hegave this field ofscience thename
chemotherapy.
Inthe 1930’s, sulphanilamide andtheother sulpha drugs were
found tobeeffective against streptococcal infections. Theproduc-
tion ofsulpha drugs reached ahigh point in1945. After that time,
theimportance ofthese drugs wasreduced bythediscovery ofpeni-
cillinandawhole host ofother antibiotics, although sulpha drugs are
stillimportant fortreating certain diseases.
The antibiotics areverycomplex organic compounds produced by
various molds. Some kill specific disease organisms; others killa
wide variety ofthem.New antibiotics arebeing discovered every year.
Names sach asaureomycin, streptomycin andchloromycin arealready
wellknown.
The effects oftheindiscriminate useofthevarious antibiotics and
other chemotherapeutic agents arenotcompletely known, andthese
drugs should beusedonlyunder thedirection ofacompetent medical
doctor.

CHAPTER 33
Chemistry andtheFuture
Necessity isthemother ofinvention.
Farquhar
Without chemical research and the scientific application ofits
results, Great Britain andherallies could nothavewonWorld War II,
although toalarge extent Mr.Everyman waskept inignorance of
many important discoveries thatmade victory certain. Once the
censorship was lifted, amarvellous neweraunfolded togiveaglimpse
offuture wonders. Forcenturies, manworked with stone, cunningly
fashioning crude implements ofagriculture and warfare. With in-
creased knowledge, theAgeofStone wassucceeded bytheBronze Age
and this, inmore recent times, wasfollowed bytheAge ofSteel.We
arenowstanding onthethreshold ofanewerawhich could truly be
called theAgeofChemistry.
During anational emergency brought about bywar,theattention of
chemists isfocussed ontheproduction ofmaterials necessary to
prosecute thewar. InWorldWar II,theallied nations’ lossofmany
vital sources ofrawrubber necessitated thediscovery andproduction
ofsynthetic substitutes. Employment offaster aeroplanes and jet
propulsion caused ademand fordifferent andbetter fuels.Many new
alloys wereneeded foruseinthelighter, wellprotected planes and in
theamazing devices connected with location finding and signalling.
Thetropical warfare ofthePacific theatre ofcombat made imperative
thediscovery ofnewdrugs andvaccines withwhich tofight disease,
amuch more powerful enemy than bullets orbombs. Then therewas
theever-present need toproduce food forourarmies andthepeople
oftheliberated countries. Aknowledge ofchemistry wasalsoneces-
sary intheproduction ofnew fertilizers, and infinding newsources of
vitamins.
Thetriumph ofthescientific method hasbrought about thegreatest
material advance inhuman history. Knowledge gained bycontrolled
experiments andobjective reasoning from observed facts hasledto
great achievements. Although there apparently isnolimit tocreative
chemistry, thescientist continues toappreciate thesignificance of
360
CHEMISTRY ANDTHEFUTURE
theory inexplaining hislaboratory observations, e.g.theformulation
oftheatomic theory hadmuch todowith thedevelopment ofthe
atomic bomb andtherelease ofatomic energy.
Practically every industry depends onthesame basicrawmaterials:
coal, limestone, salt,wood, sulphur, airandwater.Wehave reason
tobelieve thatthegreat industries ofthefuture willmake useofraw
materials frommany additional sources.
In1915,magnesium was fivedollars apound. Today, whenmanu-
factured from sea-water, itcosts buttwenty-two cents perpound.
Because sea-water contains traces ofpractically everyknown element,
itenters intothemanufacture ofmany materials besides magnesium,
e.g.bromine andbromine compounds. Will“The SaltWater Industry”
become more important than thecoal tarandpetroleum industries?
Creative chemists have carefully studied another rawmaterial, the
soyabean.Amazing asitmayseem, itiswithin therealm ofpossibility
that thisleguminous plant willenter into themanufacture ofauto-
mobile parts, window frames, paint, adhesives, extremely light but
strong plastics, printer’s ink, soap, textiles, andsynthetic rubber.
What aneffect thiswould haveupon agriculture!
Nitrogen, phosphorus, andpotassium arethethreemostimportant
elements necessary tosoil fertility. Chemists have succeeded inob-
taining anabundant supply ofthe firsttwobutnotofpotassium.
The world’s supply ofsoluble potassium salts isvery meagre, yet
Canada which imports 20,000 tons ofpotash fertilizer annually has
millions oftons offeldspar, amineral rich inpotassium. However, as
yet,noonehasdiscovered amethod ofmaking apotash fertilizer from
thisabundant mineral. This isataskawaiting theresearch chemist
and itsaccomplishment would meanmuch toCanada andCanadians.
Agricultural chemists arebeginning torealize theneed ofadding other
elements tothe soil.Foodgrown insoilcontaining added components
willbericher inmineral andvitamin content andsowillhelp to
improve thehealth oftheconsumer.
What about thenature oftheplants ofthefuture? Colchichine, a
substance developed inthelaboratory, when administered toplants,
increases their sizeenormously andimproves their vitamin content.
With new, butsimilar drugs, shallwegrow strawberries asbigas
ourlargest apples orpumpkin-sized onions? Itiswithin therealm of
possibility thatnew varieties ofplantsmaybeproduced through the
action ofdrugs yettobediscovered.
The industrial research chemist haspredicted theproduction of
remarkable substances which willrevolutionize ourpresent standards
ofliving. Unbreakable, floating glass; non-combustible wood; roof
362 CHEMISTRY FORSECONDARY SCHOOLS
tiles, flooring andwallboard ofsynthetics; plastic automobiles; wood-
plastic laminations stronger than steel; allthese aremore thanmere
dreams. The spinning andweaving industry with itshundreds of
thousands oflooms isindanger ofbecoming obsolete withthediscovery
ofanew plastic capable ofbinding cotton orother fibre material into
acloth.
There isapossibility thatcrumpled automobile fenders inthe
futuremaybesmoothed outwith ahotironbecause ofthematerial
used intheirmanufacture. Anewsynthetic rubber may findaplace in
impregnating paper bagsandsoreplace metal forpackaging “canned”
foods.Ontheother hand, there isadistinct possibility that tires of
thefuture willnotbemade ofrubber!
Inthefield ofmedicine, man isfastgaining control overnumerous
diseases thathaveexacted such atollinhuman suffering. Sulpha drugs
and penicillin arenowmanufactured onalarge scale, andnewand
more powerful chemicals obtainable from soilbacteria arepromised.
Most ofthevitamins cannowbemade synthetically andthere isa
realpossibility thatnewones willbediscovered toplay their parts in
improving health.
From theforegoing, itisobvious thatthechemist hasuntold possi-
bilities before him,andthatthestudy ofchemistry isofmajor impor-
tance. Some knowledge ofchemistry iseither valuable orabsolutely
necessary inalmost any field ofresearch, andthechemist also finds a
knowledge ofother sciences important. Hewould notthink ofcon-
ducting research inmedicine orfood production without abasic
knowledge ofanimals andplants, orofundertaking atomic research
without aknowledge ofphysics andmathematics. Theworld of
chemistry requires anincreasing number ofscientific workers, and
thepersonnel ofscience istoday fartoomeagre forthestupendous
labours ahead. Forthosewho arewilling towork, there isnolimit
totheopportunities open inthevarious fields ofchemistry.
